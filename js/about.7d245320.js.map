After submitting,\n        check that it was successfully added to the map.\n      </p>\n      <p><em>Task 3:</em>User adds new safety contact and then calls them.</p>\n      <h3>Participants:</h3>\n      <p>\n        We tested our prototype with four female University of Washington\n        students who walk alone at night at least once a week.\n      </p>\n      <h3>Method:</h3>\n      <p>\n        For each evaluation, we followed three major phases of testing in order\n        to cohesively gather quality information about our users and our app.\n        The first phase started off with an interview with each participant in\n        order to gather basic demographic information. The second phase\n        consisted of the main usability testing by providing users with a task\n        that they had to accomplish while observers recorded notes. During the\n        test, we asked participants to think out loud so that we could better\n        understand their thought process and pain points. To make it seem like a\n        real application, we used a Marvel App to conduct our usability testing.\n        Lastly, we performed a post test interview to get final details of what\n        participants thought of their experience of our solution to night\n        safety. After individually completing our usability tests, we came back\n        together to synthesize and analyze our findings. We found commonalities\n        in the features users struggled with, strengths and weaknesses of our\n        design, and suggestions for redesign.\n      </p>\n      <h3>Key Findings</h3>\n      <ul>\n        <li>\n          Users wanted to be able to share their location even when they hadn’t\n          started a path.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          Users did not expect the app to immediately call a contact after\n          clicking on their contact tile.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          Users want to be able to quickly input information when reporting a\n          hazard.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          Users stated that hazards have different urgency levels, which should\n          be reflected in the app.\n        </li>\n      </ul>\n      <div class=\"d-flex flex-column\">\n        <a\n          href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qPIgWAavYumI0R3QtWMOUUZ1rtpOxKA_/view\"\n          >Find the full usability test document here</a\n        >\n        <a\n          href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wC734_OE-8ysEgzNrrHeQwgDfsHXpCfU/view\"\n          >Find the full interface sketches document here</a\n        >\n      </div>\n      <h2>REFINEMENTS</h2>\n      <p>\n        Based on our findings from our usability tests we made some changes to\n        our designs. Below are the three main changes that we made based on user\n        feedback.\n      </p>\n      <h3>Report a Hazard:</h3>\n      <img src=\"/assets/night-owl/report.png\" alt=\"report a hazard\" />\n      <p>\n        Having different icon categories and hazard types was confusing, but\n        users still wanted hazards to be differentiated in some way. We made a\n        few changes based on this feedback:\n      </p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>\n          Removed different icon types and only allowed users to report hazards\n        </li>\n        <li>Removed hazard types</li>\n        <li>Allowed users to enter a title for the hazard</li>\n        <li>Added hazard levels (low, medium, and high danger)</li>\n      </ul>\n      <h3>Calling Safety Contact:</h3>\n      <img src=\"assets/night-owl/call.png\" alt=\"calling a safety contact\" />\n      <p>\n        When users tapped on a contact, they expected to be taken to an editing\n        page instead of it calling them, so we:\n      </p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>\n          Added a “call” button so that users would know that tapping it would\n          immediately call the contact\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          Tapping on the contact’s picture would bring them to the editing page\n        </li>\n      </ul>\n      <h3>Select a Route:</h3>\n      <img src=\"assets/night-owl/route.png\" alt=\"selecting a route\" />\n      <p>We made a few minor changes to this screen to alleviate confusion:</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Added “start route” button to collapsed menu</li>\n        <li>Moved “start route” button to the side</li>\n        <li>Added “From” text field at the top</li>\n      </ul>\n      <h2>ANNOTATED WIREFRAMES</h2>\n      <p>\n        Also based on our usability testing feedback, we redesigned and added\n        aspects to our wireframes. Then, looking back at our information\n        architecture, we created the app’s full functionality in Figma. These\n        wireframes were supposed to be low fidelity without color and real text\n        in order to strictly communicate the app’s features. We annotated each\n        screen to highlight key components and describe functionality. This step\n        helped us think about how our features worked together and was a useful\n        way to get feedback before designing our high fidelity prototypes.\n      </p>\n      <iframe\n        src=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRL2N2US5n7fW2v2BMZFqcVFdtpSxb_63q4bEmWDwWCgBMND7dLu54YJiiLi60cjkMb8bzZHOgr5VTT/embed?start=false&loop=false&delayms=60000\"\n        frameborder=\"0\"\n        width=\"100%\"\n        height=\"569\"\n        allowfullscreen=\"true\"\n        mozallowfullscreen=\"true\"\n        webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"\n      ></iframe>\n\n      <h2>HIGH FIDELITY PROTOTYPE</h2>\n      <p>\n        Based on all our research and testing, we created an app called Night\n        Owl, that students could use to feel safe when walking alone at night.\n        The app has two main components: safety circle and map.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        In the safety circle, based on interviewees stating they feel\n        comfortable when they’re walking and talking to their friend, users are\n        able to quickly and easily call their friends. If their friends are\n        busy, users can call the bot. The bot will record and talk to them,\n        mimicking a ‘friend’ listening to you in case your are in a dangerous\n        situation.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        On the map, users can select a destination and the safest path to get\n        there. Once the user starts their route, their safety contacts will be\n        alerted and the app will automatically send another notification when\n        the user gets to their final destination; this happens automatically\n        because it’s easy to forget to let your friends know you got home safe.\n        To keep the incidents up to date on the map, we use crowdsourcing; users\n        can report and confirm hazards.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        After user feedback, we made the SOS button be easily clickable, which\n        brings up a popup that counts down from 5 seconds and then calls 911. If\n        the user accidently pressed the SOS button, they can easily cancel it.\n        But we learned that it’s important the SOS button be very quick to use\n        in case of a dire situation.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        For our colors, we chose dark mode because users would be using this app\n        at night, so we wanted the screen to be subdued. Our color scheme is\n        dark blue, bright orange, and bright red. It is important to create high\n        contrast to show key information. Orange represents important actionable\n        items such as reporting a hazard and starting route. The bright red is\n        used only for the SOS button to ensure it stands out in case of\n        emergency.\n      </p>\n      <iframe\n        src=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRkHp-cF2YFbECqU7HqJx7N3RFlvbFBt5B0qjV56rOjoO5U2NFuqssJbG4mCIzL5zZhFWtvyG4Vd0LR/embed?start=false&loop=false&delayms=60000\"\n        frameborder=\"0\"\n        width=\"100%\"\n        height=\"569\"\n        allowfullscreen=\"true\"\n        mozallowfullscreen=\"true\"\n        webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"\n      ></iframe>\n      <h2>Video Demos of Night Owl:</h2>\n      <h3>Add a Contact</h3>\n      <iframe\n        width=\"100%\"\n        height=\"315\"\n        src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/EXme5E_8iGg\"\n        title=\"YouTube video player\"\n        frameborder=\"0\"\n        allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"\n        allowfullscreen\n      ></iframe>\n      <h3>Report A Hazard and Select a Route</h3>\n      <iframe\n        width=\"100%\"\n        height=\"315\"\n        src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FqrJq6qdI88\"\n        title=\"YouTube video player\"\n        frameborder=\"0\"\n        allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"\n        allowfullscreen\n      ></iframe>\n      <h3>Add New Location Favorite</h3>\n      <iframe\n        width=\"100%\"\n        height=\"315\"\n        src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ycDCc9rzfPo\"\n        title=\"YouTube video player\"\n        frameborder=\"0\"\n        allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"\n        allowfullscreen\n      ></iframe>\n\n      <h2>REFLECTION</h2>\n      <p>\n        Overall, this project was challenging and definitely stretched our\n        thinking in both design and teamwork. Working with a group to create a\n        high-fidelity mockup for a product in just 11 weeks was difficult and\n        required hard work from everyone. We learned that designing with a team\n        requires clear and effective communication, compromise, and a lot of\n        dedication. With that being said, we’re all proud of our final product\n        and enjoyed every step of the design process.\n      </p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>More user research and usability testing</li>\n        <li>\n          Explore optimizing map path finding for users going between the same\n          two places multiple times a week\n        </li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>\n        If we had more time, we definitely would have conducted more user\n        research and usability testing. Specifically, it would have been useful\n        to do competitive analysis on other technologies and services rather\n        than just apps. Also, although a phone app fit our design requirements,\n        we didn’t have much time to think about alternative forms of our final\n        product. We definitely would’ve wanted to explore other options,\n        especially since our user group of students walking at night should\n        actually be discouraged from using their phones.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        In addition, there were parts of our app that we want to test more\n        because we are unsure of their effectiveness or usefulness. One of these\n        functions is the SOS button; we had gotten a lot of feedback about how\n        to make it easily accessible while not making it easy to accidentally\n        trigger. Based on user feedback, we were able to incorporate a solution\n        into our final design, but we would want to test with more users.\n        However, it was difficult to actually test the true functionality of the\n        SOS button because it’s meant to be used in emergency situations.\n        Another feature that we were unsure about was the ability to call a Bot.\n        Some of our users said that they would feel weird talking to a Bot and\n        wouldn’t use it, while some said they would. With more time, we would’ve\n        wanted to figure out how to make this feature truly useful to our users.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        One really interesting question we received was about our research into\n        how often our users were going between the same two points every week,\n        and how we can optimize our map function to those users. This question\n        was very thought-provoking; since one of our features was pathfinding on\n        a map, we immediately turned to pre-existing solutions (e.g. Google\n        Maps, Apple Maps) as a base. However, these solutions are made to deal\n        with someone starting from anywhere and going to anywhere. Dealing with\n        the situation of users going between the same two points multiple times\n        a week might result in a completely different solution. If we had the\n        time, we would want to explore optimization for this specific situation.\n      </p>\n      <p>Finally, here are some key takeaways from each of us:</p>\n\n      <p></p>\n      <p>\n        <em>Maya:</em> At the end of the project, I was surprised by how much a\n        “final” design can still be improved. It was a little disheartening\n        seeing how much critique our (almost) final design received, but when I\n        thought about it, pretty much every design in the world can be improved\n        in some way.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <em>Valerie:</em> This has been one of the most incredible design\n        experiences I have had. I love working in groups to design artifacts\n        rather than trying to design something complex like Night Owl on your\n        own. I loved watching our project grow as we shared ideas and made\n        compromises about our designs. Each member of the team brought something\n        very unique to the table, and although it was challenging to incorporate\n        what worked best for all of us, it was in this diversity of the\n        designers in our group that we were able to produce a product that we\n        are all proud of.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <em>Peter:</em> Overall, this experience from start to finish has been\n        memorable. I enjoyed collaborating with my teammates as we each had\n        important contributions to Night Owl. As for the project itself, we may\n        have finished the first iteration of the high fidelity prototype, but\n        there is still much improvements we can make, especially after our final\n        critique.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <em>Lia:</em>I learned how to optimize time and create quality work by\n        understanding and using each team mate’s skills and passions. At\n        different steps in our process, each one of us went above and beyond to\n        help the project excel.\n      </p>\n      <img class=\"mb-5\" src=\"assets/night-owl/team.png\" alt=\"the night owl team\" />\n  </PortfolioPiece>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nimport PortfolioPiece from \"@/components/layouts/PortfolioPiece.vue\";\n\nexport default {\n  components: {\n    PortfolioPiece,\n  },\n};\n</script>","import mod from \"-!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--13-0!../../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--1-0!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./night-owl.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"; export default mod; export * from \"-!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--13-0!../../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--1-0!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./night-owl.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"","import { render, staticRenderFns } from \"./night-owl.vue?vue&type=template&id=9e396248&\"\nimport script from \"./night-owl.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\nexport * from \"./night-owl.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\n\n\n/* normalize component */\nimport normalizer from \"!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/runtime/componentNormalizer.js\"\nvar component = normalizer(\n  script,\n  render,\n  staticRenderFns,\n  false,\n  null,\n  null,\n  null\n  \n)\n\nexport default component.exports","export * from \"-!../../../node_modules/mini-css-extract-plugin/dist/loader.js??ref--7-oneOf-1-0!../../../node_modules/css-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--7-oneOf-1-1!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/loaders/stylePostLoader.js!../../../node_modules/postcss-loader/src/index.js??ref--7-oneOf-1-2!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--1-0!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./on-trak.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&id=69bb6f04&scoped=true&lang=css&\"","var render = function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _c('PortfolioPiece',[_c('div',{staticClass:\"title\"},[_c('h1',[_vm._v(\"OnTrak Troubleshooting\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\" Empowering users to resolve product conflicts without calling for help \")]),_c('hr')]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\" During the summer of 2021, I was given the opportunity to intern at Digital Control Inc.

Over the course of 6\n      months, our team planned, researched, and designed a financial literacy\n      application that draws upon users own finances as a baseline for their\n      learning experience.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      To motivate our design process, we used began by developing the following\n      research and design questions:\n    </p>\n    <b>Research Questions:</b>\n    <ul>\n      <li>What categories of financial literacy are most useful to users?</li>\n      <li>What does financial literacy mean to users?</li>\n      <li>What is the easiest way for someone to build wealth?</li>\n      <li>How do you move from paycheck-to-paycheck to accumulate wealth?</li>\n      <li>\n        What are the differences in the knowledge base between those who have\n        financial literacy and those who do not?\n      </li>\n      <li>Why are users motivated to learn about finances?</li>\n      <li>\n        What are the most effective ways to engage users on financial literacy?\n      </li>\n      <li>How do people avoid and escape debt?</li>\n    </ul>\n    <b>Design Questions: </b>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        How can we make financial literacy education more quick, fun, and\n        accessible and help build individuals’ wealth?\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Do we design financial literacy education within users’ finance tools or\n        outside of it?\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n\n    <h2>User Research</h2>\n    <p>\n      To begin, we conducted several rounds of user research. We conducted\n      secondary research, a survey, and interviews.

Initially, we intended\n      for both Mark and Laura to be primary users, but during our research, we\n      noticed that a lot of the pain points for our older and younger users were\n      similar. After a meeting with our stakeholders, we decided to focus our\n      design in intervening earlier so that the newer users don't make the same\n      mistakes as their older counterparts. Because our focus was on Mark, we\n      decided to focus a large portion of our design motivation around the goal\n      of understanding and paying off student debt.\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"d-flex flex-column justify-content-between\">\n      <div class=\"horiz\">\n        <img src=\"assets/fin-lit/mark.png\" alt=\"Mark Persona\" />\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"horiz\">\n        <img src=\"assets/fin-lit/laura.png\" alt=\"Laura Persona\" />\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <h3>User Journey Maps</h3>\n    <p>\n      After creating personas, we made two user journey maps to highlight the\n      experiences that our users have with financial literacy. Mark's journey\n      map has a huge focus on social media financial literacy, advice from\n      parents, and stress about money along with a lack of understanding of how\n      credit and debit work. Laura's journey has a focus on providing for her\n      family, gaining skills to make money, protecting her finances from\n      overdraft fees, and getting advice from her bank about her finances.\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"d-flex flex-lg-row flex-column justify-content-between\">\n      <div class=\"horiz\">\n        <img src=\"assets/fin-lit/mark_jm.png\" alt=\"Mark Map\" />\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"horiz\">\n        <img src=\"assets/fin-lit/laura_jm.png\" alt=\"Laura Map\" />\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <h2>Ideation</h2>\n    <p>\n      After our user research, we began to create problem statements and design\n      goals to center our ideation.\n    </p>\n    <b>Problem Statements</b>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        Users often feel overwhelmed, lost, or intimidated knowing how to start\n        learning about finances\n      </li>\n      <li>Users lack the motivation to practice financial literacy</li>\n      <li>\n        Financial practices like 401k or savings are abstract and can be\n        difficult for users to visualize the benefits\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Users are given advice that is not impactful to their current experience\n        and suffers from \"shouldism\" for example \"I should be investing\" or \"I\n        should be in crypto\"\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n    <b>Design Goals</b>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        Balance giving the user impactful knowledge, but also allowing them to\n        explore various financial interests. We call this Free-range design vs.\n        Paternal design.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Leave users feeling confident in their financial knowledge and the\n        progress they are making in their learning\n      </li>\n      <li>Provide valuable information to help them here and now</li>\n      <li>\n        Clearly present information that is valuable to them using visual\n        representations\n      </li>\n      <li>Create a trusting and nonjudgemental learning environment</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>\n      After coming together to create these design goals, it was time to start\n      generating ideas about what tools might be helpful in the creation of a\n      financial literacy application. To address this, we went through several\n      design activities to scope out our solution space, this involved: crazy\n      8's, storyboarding, and the creation of workflows.\n    </p>\n    <h3>Crazy 8's</h3>\n    <p>\n      To begin our ideation, we wanted to generate as many ideas a possible by\n      doing crazy 8s. We each quickly sketched 8 screens on our own, and then\n      posted our work in the team FigJam. We then divided up each crazy-8's\n      document into individual screens and grouped the screens based on\n      functionality to decide where the team had the most overlap in their\n      ideation through the categories: onboarding, progress dashboard, learning\n      simulation, lesson layout, testing content, resource locators, resource\n      helpers, and financial calculators. With this overview of ideas, we then\n      entered the storyboarding phase, in which we took these ideas and thought\n      about what those might look like for our users.\n    </p>\n    <img src=\"assets/fin-lit/crazy8.png\" alt=\"crazy 8s\" />\n    <h3>Storyboards</h3>\n    <p>\n      Following our crazy 8's and a review of user research from previous weeks,\n      we created storyboards to explore how potential problem-solving ideas\n      would be accessed by our personas.\n    </p>\n    <img src=\"assets/fin-lit/storyboards.png\" alt=\"storyboards\" />\n    <p>\n      <b>Results:</b>\n      Storyboarding helped us identify how we can fit key features into an app\n      format. It also helped us imagine when and where users would need these\n      features. This gave us some direction in our Information Architecture,\n      helping us decide which ideated features to include, as well as in what\n      order these features should appear in our application's hierarchy.\n    </p>\n    <h3>User Workflows</h3>\n    <p>\n      We began our wireframes with the design kit created by Chime. For this\n      first iteration, we focused on onboarding processes, knowledge checks and\n      lesson plans. The workflow diagrams served as the blueprint for our\n      wireframes. However, as we prototyped more and discussed as a group, we\n      later changed certain aspects of our design. Critiquing the workflow\n      diagrams as a group led us to refine ideas more and to decide which ideas\n      were supported by our codebook and persona's needs.\n    </p>\n    <img src=\"assets/fin-lit/workflow.png\" alt=\"storyboards\" />\n    <h2>Design and Iteration</h2>\n    <p>\n      In the design of our final application, we went through three rounds of\n      iteration, which are highlighted below. In this process, we were able to\n      refine our scope, and focus on features that would be the most helpful for\n      our users!\n    </p>\n    <h3>Iteration 1: Onboarding and Lessons</h3>\n    <p>\n      We began our wireframes with the design kit created by Chime.

One of the\n      biggest areas for growth that we came across in our end product was the\n      quality and depth of the lessons. To better develop these lessons and\n      ideas, an important next step would be to focus on UX writing and content\n      strategy to more effectively present the financial literacy content to our\n      users. Although the content we present is helpful, it may not be portrayed\n      in the cleanest way, and there is definitely room for improvement.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      We also ended the project with a user testing session. Although we got\n      decent reviews from our users, there was still a large amount of feedback\n      which would help us improve our application. I am most excited about the\n      inclusion of how much money has been put towards your goal at the top of\n      the goal details page to show how much progress has been made towards the\n      goal to motivate the user to make more progress towards their goals. There\n      were improvements to be made to the lessons within our application.\n      Although the content was solid, the layout could use more reworking. We\n      would add more color and engagement factors within the application, and\n      would work to make the screens full of less text.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      If we were continued with this project, we would also want to create more\n      screens and flows for our user's learning experience such as the\n      prototyping out the savings flow, budgeting flow, custom goal flow, and\n      more content for the lessons that are available in the skill builder\n      section. We then, obviously, would perform more user testing and\n      iterations upon our product with users who are working paycheck to\n      paycheck.\n    </p>\n    <h2>Reflection</h2>\n    <p>\n      This capstone project was a great experience. I was worried at the start\n      of this project to be designing for financial literacy when I really did\n      not know very much about financial literacy myself. During our interview\n      process, our intended user groups had just about as much financial\n      literacy awareness as we did. One of the biggest barriers, especially\n      among the college students, was the lack of stable income as a student.\n      Our interviews with the older generation of users, had similar insights\n      about what happens when you neglect financial literacy, and it also gave\n      me insight into the pains associated with debt, especially for those in\n      lower incomes. It was in our interview with the financial professor at UW\n      that we were able to start to learn financial literacy, which was a key\n      facet to having successful designs. Personally, I talked to my dad about\n      financial literacy for the first time during this project. He seemed\n      really excited that I was interested in learning financial literacy, and\n      I'm grateful that this project allowed me to increase my financial\n      literacy skills. It also motivated me to continue my own financial\n      literacy journey after this project is complete.\n    </p>\n\n    <div\n      class=\"\n        d-flex\n        flex-column flex-md-row\n        text-center\n        justify-content-center justify-content-lg-end\n      \"\n    >\n      <router-link to=\"/on-trak\"\n        ><b>Next Project: </b>OnTrak Troubleshooting</router-link\n      >\n    </div>\n  </PortfolioPiece>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nimport PortfolioPiece from \"@/components/layouts/PortfolioPiece.vue\";\n\nexport default {\n  components: {\n    PortfolioPiece,\n  },\n};\n</script>\n<style scoped style=\"scss\">\n.chart {\n  padding: 0;\n}\n/*\n.horiz {\n  display: flex;\n  flex-flow: column;\n  width: 49%;\n}*/\n@media screen and (max-width: 992px) {\n  .horiz {\n    display: flex;\n    flex-flow: column;\n    width: 100%;\n    padding-bottom: 10px;\n  }\n}\n\n.c {\n  text-align: center;\n  font-weight: bold;\n  margin-bottom: 5px;\n}\n\n.screen {\n  display: block;\n  width: 80%;\n  margin: auto;\n}\n</style>","import mod from \"-!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--13-0!../../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--1-0!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./fin-lit.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\";

Due to my inability to count my stitches correctly\n      in each of the rows I completed, the first blanket I made came out as more\n      of a trapezoid than a rectangle. The other big issue that most novice\n      crochet hobbyists is keeping a consistent tension in the amount that you\n      pull on the yarn to create each stitch. Crochet Buddy is an Internet of\n      Things (IoT) device created to assist novice crochet hobbyists in their\n      pursuit of beautiful yarn-craft. This project consisted of exploration in:\n      analog prototyping, 3D modeling, Voice User Interface, and AI stitch\n      tracking.\n    </p>\n    <img\n      class=\"p-0\"\n      src=\"assets/crochet-buddy/sketch.png\"\n      alt=\"crochet buddy sketch\"\n    />\n\n    <h2>Design Overview</h2>\n    <p>\n      The Crochet Buddy is a fairly simple IoT device with a large impact on\n      those who crochet. The physical device has three main components: an\n      ergonomic handle, a camera facing the crochet hook’s neck, which counts\n      the number of stitches and tracks which type of stitches are being made\n      using a machine learning algorithm. The hook also has a pressure sensitive\n      hook, which tracks the amount of force exerted each time the user pulls\n      for the stitch. The hook will also vibrate when the user should stop\n      pulling on the stitch, thus enforcing a consistent pull, making the\n      yarn-craft more consistent.\n    </p>\n    <iframe\n      width=\"100%\"\n      height=\"315\"\n      src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/X2v73GxMAIo\"\n      title=\"YouTube video player\"\n      frameborder=\"0\"\n      allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"\n      allowfullscreen\n    ></iframe>\n\n    <h2>Analog Prototype</h2>\n    <p>\n      The analog prototype for Crochet Buddy was made out of 3 ingredient clay\n      (made with flour, water, and salt) as well as a crochet hook that I had\n      lying around my room. I made the clay for the hook, and then wrapped it\n      around my hook around to form a handle. I then took and extra bit of clay\n      to figure out what the camera placement would look like. After the handle\n      was formed, I took it off of my crochet hook, and baked it until the clay\n      became sturdy. I then put the handle back on my crochet hook for user\n      testing. The first handle iteration is shown below.\n    </p>\n    <img\n      class=\"pt-0\"\n      src=\"assets/crochet-buddy/analog_1.jpeg\"\n      alt=\"crochet buddy sketch\"\n    />\n    <p>\n      I actually went through two prototypes while designing this hook. The\n      first prototype turned out to be far too bulky and big, so I created a\n      sleeker and smaller handle, which ended up being the better of the two, as\n      shown below.\n    </p>\n    <img\n      class=\"pt-0\"\n      src=\"assets/crochet-buddy/analog_2.jpeg\"\n      alt=\"crochet buddy sketch\"\n    />\n    <b>Analysis</b>\n    <p>\n      The grip that I created for my prototype makes holding the crochet hooks\n      that I have so much more comfortable, that I actually find myself using\n      the lo-fi prototype handle when I’m planning on crocheting for longer\n      periods of time. This is a testament to the biggest feature that I was\n      using my analog model to test for: comfort and grip positioning.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      During the analysis phase, I also took a video of what the camera would\n      see. This was to see if it was even possible to use machine learning to\n      track stitches in this way. It did prove that there is a distinct\n      possibility that machine learning for stitch counting in this way is a\n      distinct possibility.\n    </p>\n    <h2>3D Prototyping</h2>\n    <p>\n      The 3D model of Crochet Buddy was made in Onshape: a collaborative CAD\n      modeling program. I began the model as a sketch the front plane. This\n      sketch contained a half view of the side profile of Crochet Buddy’s main\n      form. As you can see, the sketch captures the rounded features of crochet\n      buddy which make it more comfortable to use.\n    </p>\n    <img\n      src=\"assets/crochet-buddy/3d_sketch.png\"\n      alt=\"line sketch for crochet buddy\"\n    />\n    <p>\n      Next, I use the revolve feature for the above sketch, to create the base\n      for Crochet Buddy. this lead to a very simple three-dimensional figure\n      that works as the base for Crochet Buddy.\n    </p>\n    <img\n      src=\"assets/crochet-buddy/3d_round.png\"\n      alt=\"revolve for crochet buddy\"\n    />\n    <p>\n      Once the main 3D form for Crochet Buddy was completed, I created a new\n      sketch, again on the front plane. These sketches are on the same plane to\n      ensure that the sketches overlap and can actually be used for extrudes.\n    </p>\n    <img\n      src=\"assets/crochet-buddy/3d_cut.png\"\n      alt=\"sketch for crochet hook cut\"\n    />\n    <p>\n      In order to create the cutout that makes up the hook for Crochet Buddy, I\n      used an extrude cut. The extrude cut took the material from the triangle\n      that I had sketched away from the hook. The more angular slanted nature of\n      the cutout for Crochet Buddy is based off of the angular style of Susan\n      Bates crochet hooks, which are objectively the easiest to work with. Most\n      others are too rounded, which makes it difficult to capture the loops that\n      are being pulled through to create a stitch.\n    </p>\n    <img\n      src=\"assets/crochet-buddy/3d_clear.png\"\n      alt=\"cut for crochet buddy hook\"\n    />\n    <p>\n      For the third time, I created a sketch on the front plane. This time, it\n      was nestled against the thick grip section of the handle, on top of the\n      beginning of the hook. This is the ideal placement because it is out of\n      the way for the user, and it has a pretty solid view down the neck of the\n      hook, which is the vantage point used for counting and tracking stitches.\n    </p>\n    <img\n      src=\"assets/crochet-buddy/3d_camera.png\"\n      alt=\"sketch for crochet buddy camera\"\n    />\n    <p>\n      To create the camera housing, based off of the initial sketch, I used an\n      extrude on the square. I extruded both to the left and to the right with\n      the sketch on the front plane as my “center point.” This allowed me to\n      make the camera housing evenly centered on the hook so that the camera\n      would have the clearest view down the hook’s neck.\n    </p>\n    <img\n      src=\"assets/crochet-buddy/3d_cam_col.png\"\n      alt=\"extrude for crochet buddy camera\"\n    />\n    <p>\n      Finally, to make the the 3D model more aesthetically pleasing and appear\n      to be more realistic, I used the appearance feature of Onshape to apply a\n      blue color to the hook part of Crochet Buddy. This blue color mimics the\n      standard color for 5mm crochet hooks.\n    </p>\n    <img\n      src=\"assets/crochet-buddy/3d_color.png\"\n      alt=\"final model for crochet buddy\"\n    />\n    <div class=\"text-center\">\n      <a\n        href=\"https://cad.onshape.com/documents/6fe367458e9e7df097cd1b08/w/c87550b82174ec9333dfbd76/e/b54d1e8d204f7130c8ada965\"\n        target=\"_blank\"\n        >You can view the 3D model here.</a\n      >\n    </div>\n    <b>Analysis</b>\n    <p>\n      Because I’ve taken classes on CAD modeling before, I am fairly content\n      with the decisions that I made to create the 3D model for Crochet Buddy.\n      The 3D model created in Onshape resembles my analog model very nicely. The\n      only real downfall of my prototype is that it is not fully constrained.\n      But, as you can see, the dimensions of the model appear to be correct.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Overall, I am incredibly proud of the 3D model for Crochet Buddy. but\n      there are definitely still areas for improvement. In the future, I would\n      probably do some deeper multi-piece assemblies with constraints in the\n      button interactions. I would include a button that would be used to\n      “indicate the end of the first line of stitches, and any other changes\n      made by the user while working on their piece. This would be located on\n      the trip of the handle. I would also possibly add a long thin button going\n      down the entire length of the hook, that would actually be what was used\n      to gauge the pressure in the pulls for each stitch.\n    </p>\n    <h2>Voice User Interface</h2>\n    <p>\n      Although Crochet Buddy has functionality for a crotchetier of any skill\n      levels, this iteration focuses on Crochet Buddy as a resource for total\n      beginners to learn crochet with real time feedback. Never again will a\n      novice crochetier be left wondering if they missed a step, misunderstood\n      the directions, or did something wrong. The design for the educational\n      aspect of crochet buddy has two main aspects:\n    </p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        An updated analog prototype which includes the ability to attach an\n        actual web camera to Crochet Buddy.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        The VUI which prompts users step by step how to crochet, by explaining\n        the steps to make a variety of stitches.\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n    <b>Goal</b>\n    <p>\n      From the start of my exploration into the development of Crochet buddy, I\n      had the idea in my head that novice a crochetier would be able to use it\n      as a platform to learn crochet, and to follow along with patterns from the\n      internet. The goal of this iteration is to gauge both the usability and\n      feasibility of learning using only a VUI alone, albeit one paired with\n      stitch tracking capabilities.\n    </p>\n    <b>Analog Prototype</b>\n    <p>\n      The analog model of Crochet Buddy followed a similar form to the original\n      Crochet Buddy hook. The biggest factor taken into account in this model\n      was the idea that I wanted the camera to have a full view of all of the\n      hook that was open to yarn. But, the focal length of my web camera was\n      super short, which meant that I had to cover a very large amount of the\n      hook in order for the camera to have this full perspective of the yarn on\n      the hook.\n    </p>\n    <img\n      class=\"pt-0\"\n      src=\"assets/crochet-buddy/vui_analog.png\"\n      alt=\"analog model for crochet buddy vui\"\n    />\n    <p>\n      Although the appearance of the new hook and handle is a lot bulkier, due\n      to my constraints, it definitely shows a very clean video feed.

You have learned the double crochet. You are now at the point where you can start making crochet items!</p>\n    <div class=\"text-center\">\n      <a\n        href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sw-pY2WbI3VCdQqk_Mk5MY1IYT0yUQpTpH7eHamClxk/edit?usp=sharing\"\n        target=\"_target\"\n        >You can view the document with all the VUI scripts here.</a\n      >\n    </div>\n    <b>Demo</b>\n    <p>\n      The final aspect of Crochet Buddy was the demo video, which showcases the\n      VUI and stitch tracking camera working together to deliver an easy and\n      seamless way to learn crochet!\n    </p>\n    <iframe\n      width=\"100%\"\n      height=\"315\"\n      src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pvUAqp3lwj4\"\n      title=\"YouTube video player\"\n      frameborder=\"0\"\n      allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"\n      allowfullscreen\n    ></iframe>\n    <b>Evaluation</b>\n    <p>\n      When I was initially thinking about Learning with Crochet Buddy, I wanted\n      to include a Graphical User Interface (GUI) with the VUI so that the user\n      would be able to see what they are supposed to be doing, in addition to\n      hearing it from the VUI, while they are doing it. But, I also wanted to\n      see how feasible it would be to learn Crochet by voice alone. To test the\n      VUI’s effectiveness on it’s own, I ran a VUI usability test with my mom\n      over Zoom. Because the Crochet Hook that my mom was using was poorly made\n      and almost impossible to use, we decided to skip over the triple crochet\n      section of the tutorial script.\n    </p>\n    <iframe\n      width=\"100%\"\n      height=\"315\"\n      src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/02jf-K-xQZQ\"\n      title=\"YouTube video player\"\n      frameborder=\"0\"\n      allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"\n      allowfullscreen\n    ></iframe>\n    <p>\n      The main findings from this evaluation was that knowing the number of\n      stitches that need to be on the hook is important information for the\n      user, when they are learning any crochet stitch, even if Crochet Buddy is\n      tracking it for them. It seems to be critical to the learning process for\n      the user to either have a view of what the state of the yarn should look\n      like as a picture, or to know the number of loops that should be on the\n      hook at any given time.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      It also became incredibly apparent that in any future iterations of\n      Crochet Buddy it is important to only use the\n      <a\n        href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Susan-Bates-Silvalume-Crochet-Pouch/dp/B000XZYISM\"\n        target=\"_blank\"\n        >Susan Bates Hooks</a\n      >, which are the most well loved hooks in the world of crochet. The other\n      generic crochet hooks just did not work very effectively, and made it\n      incredibly difficult for my mother to even attempt the steps Crochet Buddy\n      was giving her.\n    </p>\n\n    <b>Analysis</b>\n    <p>\n      Although the analog prototype shows how effective the vantage point of\n      having a camera embedded in the hook of Crochet Buddy’s handle is, the web\n      camera that I used for this analog prototype proved to be bulky and had a\n      very narrow view point. The bulky clip on the camera made it very\n      difficult to hold the analog prototype, while the narrow camera angle made\n      it so that there could only be a very small portion of the hook open for\n      yarn in order for the camera to view all the loops on the hook.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The next steps in furthering the Crochet Buddy analog design would be the\n      use of a smaller camera with a wider lens that does not interfere with the\n      quality and comfort of the handle grip of Crochet Buddy. It would be\n      mounted in such a way where it would be angled to see a bigger portion of\n      the crochet hook.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The VUI combined with stitch tracking also hold promise. From the demo\n      video, it is clear that having live feedback from Crochet Buddy, with\n      limited vocal interactions, could be an easy and fun way to learn crochet.\n      The biggest change to the VUI would be to add an additional sentence to\n      each of the lines that the VUI gives, stating the number of loops that\n      should be on the hook at any given time. Although I thought having Crochet\n      Buddy’s stitch tracking would be enough to help the user, my testing it\n      proved that the user would like to know the number of loops that should be\n      on the hook. Having the VUI state the number of loops there should be\n      proves effective then it would be able to be distributed without\n      connection to an app. Future iterations of Crochet Buddy would also\n      instructions for more stitches than the three stitches used for this\n      prototype.

By looking at the\n      accessibility of parks, as well as the quality of those parks, it is\n      possible to gain a better understanding of their impact within the greater\n      Seattle community.\n      <br /><br />\n      This study seeks to work along a similar framework to the broken window\n      thoery which uses the number of broken windows to guague the amount of\n      crime - more broken windows incidates higher rates of crime (Koglmeier).\n      But, instead of the number of broken windows, we will be using the number\n      of parks, as well as the quality of those parks.\n      <br /><br />\n      Across all of the literature that I reviewed, a key factor in the\n      effectiveness of these parks and natural spaces - a key peice to making\n      these public spaces effective is the need for a human centered approach\n      with community engagement during the erection of these institutions\n      (Koglmeier,Green Space and Crime, Ross). It is the human centered\n      involvment in the development of these programs and spaces that makes the\n      difference in these harm reduction programs. These spaces are not a means\n      to an end in an of it self, but a proxy for community engagement (Ross).\n      This poses a difficult question within my research in which the ways in\n      which the databases I choose do not really include data about community\n      invovlement within the development of these areas. Similarly, in the\n      literature I reviewed, having greenspace does not automatically reduce\n      crime; instead, these parks need to be well maintained and must not have\n      hidden spots where crime could occur (Green Space and Crime). Luckily, in\n      the Greenspace database, there is a tier ranking of the parks from 1 - 6\n      in which 1 is the highest tier and 6 is the lowest tier. This ranking\n      scale could probably be used to mirror the quality of the park and more\n      deeply understand park quality as it relates to crime rates.\n    </p>\n    <h2>Research Questions and Hypotheses</h2>\n    <ul>\n      <li><b>RQ1: </b> Do areas with more greenspace have less crime?</li>\n      <li>\n        <b>H1: </b> I beleive that there will be less crime in areas with more\n        greenspace.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <b>RQ2: </b> Does the the quality of parks in the area affect the amount\n        of crime?\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <b>H2: </b> I believe that having higher quality parks will be an\n        indicator of less crime.\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n    <h2>Methods</h2>\n    <p>\n      Listed below are the steps that I took during my data analysis.

For each crime or park percentage, it is the total\n      number of crimes or parks in the neighborhood divded by the total number\n      of parks or crime in all of Seattle.\n    </p>\n    <img\n      src=\"assets/nature/all_hoods_compare.png\"\n      alt=\"neighborhood breakdown: percentage of overall crime and parks\"\n    />\n    <p>\n      As shown in 'Neighborhood Breakdown: Percentage of Overall Crime and\n      Parks' chart, we have a mix of neighborhoods in which the percentage of\n      crime is higher than the percentage of parks and vice versa. This means\n      that there might potentially be an impact of parks on reducing crime.\n      <br /><br />\n      The next two charts make the same comparison of percentages of crime and\n      parks, but groups them together by whether there was a higher percentage\n      of parks or a higher percentage of crime.\n      <br /><br />\n      In this chart, we look at the neighborhoods where there are more parks.\n    </p>\n    <img\n      src=\"assets/nature/high_crime.png\"\n      alt=\"high crime breakdown percentage of overall crime and parks\"\n    />\n    <p>\n      In this chart, most neighborhoods have over 3% of the parks in Seattle and\n      8 of these neighborhoods had over 5% of the parks. The exception to this\n      is Seward park, which has 2.7% of the parks, but again, this could be due\n      to the size of the area. We also see that most neighborhoods in this\n      bracket have between 3% and 6% of the crime in Seattle.\n      <br /><br />\n      In this chart, we look at the neighborhoods where there is more crime.\n    </p>\n    <img\n      src=\"assets/nature/high_park.png\"\n      alt=\"high park breakdown: percentage of overall crime and parks\"\n    />\n    <p>\n      In this chart, most neighborhoods have under 3% of the parks in Seattle.\n      There are two exception of note.

We also\n      see that most neighborhoods have between 3% and 7% of the crime in\n      Seattle.\n      <br /><br />\n      There seems to be a slight difference here for the average range of crime\n      when the number of parks is concerned.

In the\n      condition in which there is a higher amount of crime, the average\n      percentage of crimes is 6.1% which is about double the average percentage\n      of parks 3%. But, in the condition where there are more parks, the average\n      number of parks is far higher at 6.6%, and the average amount of crime\n      much lower at around .5%.\n      <br /><br />\n      <em\n        >This seems to indicate that having more parks does have a potential\n        association with a reduction in crime</em\n      >\n    </p>\n    <hr />\n    <b\n      >RQ2: Does the the quality of parks in the area affect the amount of\n      crime?</b\n    >\n    <p>\n      To begin this section, let's talk a little bit about what the park ratings\n      mean within the parks database. This rating system is on a scale from 1 -6\n      with a 1 being the best possible park, and 6 being the worst park.\n      <br /><br />\n      This chart comes from comparing the average park ratings across the\n      condition of having a higher percentage of parks when compared to crime.\n    </p>\n    <img\n      src=\"assets/nature/high_park_rating.png\"\n      alt=\"high park breakdown: average park rating\"\n    />\n    <p>\n      In the areas with more parks, there is also a better rating for the park,\n      and more diversity within the park rating averages. The best average\n      rating in this range is 2.3 and the worst average rating is 4.\n      <br /><br />\n      This chart shows the average rating for parks within a given neighborhood\n      in areas where there is a higher percentage crime than there is parks.\n    </p>\n    <img\n      src=\"assets/nature/high_crime_rating.png\"\n      alt=\"high crime breakdown: average park rating\"\n    />\n    <p>\n      As you can see, there is not a whole lot of variation across these\n      neighborhoods. The worst average park rating is 4.2 and the best rating is\n      3.6.\n      <br /><br />\n      Our final analysis seeks to compare the average park rating across all\n      neighborhoods in the condition of having a higher percentage of crime than\n      parks and having a higher percentage of parks than crime.\n    </p>\n\n    <img\n      src=\"assets/nature/high_crime_rating.png\"\n      alt=\"average park rating based on distribution of park and crime\"\n    />\n    <p>\n      This chart shows that in the condition in which there is a higher\n      percentage of crime than parks the average park rating is 3.9. In the\n      condition in which there is a higher percentage of parks than crime, the\n      average park rating is 3.3. There is a .6 difference in the average rating\n      in which the areas with a higher percentage of parks tend to have overall\n      higher quality parks\n      <br /><br />\n      <em\n        >This might indicate that parks in areas which there is less crime also\n        have higher quality.\n      </em>\n    </p>\n\n    <h2>Discussion</h2>\n    <p>\n      This analysis seems to suggest an inverse correlational relationship\n      between the number and quality of parks and crime rates. In this case,\n      areas with more, higher quality parks see less crime.\n      <br /><br />\n      <b>RQ1 asked Do areas with more greenspace have less crime? </b> We found\n      that on average, areas with a higher percentage of parks had drastically\n      less crime when compared to areas with higher percentages of crime that\n      had an smaller assortment of parks. <br /><br />\n      <b\n        >RQ2 asked Does the the quality of parks in the area affect the amount\n        of crime?</b\n      >\n      We concluded that on average, areas with a higher percentage of crime had\n      parks of lower quality when compared to areas with a higher percentage of\n      parks. <br /><br />\n      Both of my hypotheses were confirmed, and there does seem to be a\n      relationship between the amount of crime and the quality and accessibility\n      of nature in the city. But, this does not seek to prove causation. There\n      are several potential factors that could influence these results namely:\n    </p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        <b>Population within a neighborhood:</b> There are a lot of industrial\n        areas within Seattle which might not have that many people living in it,\n        which could be a reason for fewer, lower quality green spaces.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <b>Size of the neighborhood:</b> Not every neighborhood in Seattle is\n        the same size. The smaller neighborhoods might have less crime and fewer\n        parks simply because there is less space for them.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <b>Socioeconomic status within a neighborhood: </b> Those in lower\n        socioeconomic classes might not be afforded the \"nicer\" parks due to\n        strucutral injustice within our governing bodies and the ways in which\n        cities sometimes distribute funds based on the overall income of those\n        living in the neighborhoods. There could also be higher crime rates\n        becaues there are people making less, and they would not have the time\n        to visit the green spaces. We also tend to see more policing in areas of\n        lower socioeconomic status, which of course leads to higher rates of\n        crime being reported, but it does not necesarily mean that there is not\n        a similar amount of crime going on in the higher socioeconomic status\n        neighborhoods in which there is less police patroling.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <b>Ratio of stores, housing, and natural spaces in a neighborhood: </b\n        >One of the most noticable outliers for crime and green space was\n        downtown. Which might be an indicator that areas that have a higher\n        focus on retail have less of a need for green space because people can\n        go home to their neighborhoods, which might have more greenspace, when\n        they are done with their retail adventures. Or, it could also indicate\n        that these places of business present more opportunities for crime, such\n        as theft, which would be harder to do in a more residential area.\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>\n      It was really fascinating to look at the ways in which available natural\n      spaces varies within Seattle, and this sets a great foundation which could\n      potentially be the backbone for more research such as taking into account\n      the factors listed above in additional research. Or, to potentially set\n      the baseline for an ethnographic study which talks to people in these\n      neighborhoods to learn more about how residents relationships to nature\n      vary in the neighborhoods with a higher percentage of crime than parks and\n      those with a higher percentage of parks than crime.\n    </p>\n    <h2>Conclusion</h2>\n    <p>\n      Having access to natural greenspace can be very benefical to human health\n      and well being. But, not everyone has the same level of access to natural\n      spaces due to the ways in which society has been developed. This research\n      study sought to answer two questions: (1) Do areas with more greenspace\n      have less crime? (2) Do areas with more greenspace have less crime?\n      <br /><br />\n      For research question 1, it was hypothesized there will be less crime in\n      areas with more greenspace. This hypothesis was confirmed when they study\n      found that on average, areas with a higher percentage of parks had\n      drastically less crime when compared to areas with higher percentages of\n      crime that had an smaller assortment of parks.\n      <br /><br />\n      For research question 2, it was hypothesized that having higher quality\n      parks will be an indicator of less crime. This hypothesis ws confirmed\n      when the study found that on average, areas with a higher percentage of\n      crime had parks of lower quality when compared to areas with a higher\n      percentage of parks.\n      <br /><br />\n      Of course, these finding do have some limitations. There are a lot of\n      other variables that might play into the reason that there is less crime\n      in areas with more parks and greenspace. The majors factors that might be\n      at play in this relationship are population in a neighborhood, size of the\n      neighborhood, socioeconomic status within a neighborhood, and the ratio of\n      stores, housing and natural space in a neighborhood. Further studies\n      should consider the impact of these factors. This may also serve as a call\n      to action to add set up areas in which having more, higher quality parks\n      added could potentially be beneficial.\n    </p>\n\n    <h2>Citations</h2>\n    <p>\n      Green Space and crime.

This redesign started with user research, to understand the\n        audience of Seattle Public Transit in order to design for the actual\n        audience. Next, came the creation of six tasks that a user on Seattle\n        Public Transit would complete. Three of these tasks would be designed\n        for a mobile platform, and three of these tasks would be made for a\n        kiosk interaction which would be located at a transit stop. Next, there\n        were diagrams of user flows, to understand how the user would interact\n        with the system while completing their tasks. Then, we created low\n        fidelity wireframes to understand and test the layout of these\n        interactions. Then, we created mood boards and picked a typographic\n        hierarchy and a color scheme. Finally, we created high fidelity\n        wireframes which showcased the fully designed interactions.\n      </p>\n      <h2>USER RESEARCH</h2>\n      <p>\n        The Seattle public transit system is an integral part of the community\n        and has a multitude of considerations to design for.

On top of the primary users though, we see a large\n        number of stakeholders who are also affected by public transportation.\n        Because this transit system is funded by the government, that means that\n        our taxes partially go towards paying for this system. So, anyone who\n        pays taxes is going to be a stakeholder in the system. A few special\n        considerations to account for when considering the audience of public\n        transit is to remember the edge case users. There are a fair number of\n        disabled people who are in chairs or who have walkers that take the bus.\n        We also have homeless people riding the bus occasionally because it is\n        the cheapest and warmest thing to do in the cold Seattle winters.

Colleges choose to move classes to an entirely virtual platform consisting of both asynchronous and synchronous classes to keep as many people safe as possible from this deadly virus. Many students both asynchronous and synchronous classes in their schedule. The main difference between these two class formats is that synchronous classes have a set time where students and the professor got together in a video conference of some sort, typically Zoom, and have lecture and section live.

Second there is focus (or lack thereof) and meeting class goals, which consists of the codes: methods of focus, mental barrier to focus, accountability for getting work done, distraction from focus, feelings about being distracted. Finally, there is virtual classroom culture and how it differs from in person, which consists of the codes: participation, breakout room variation, technical difficulties, frustration, online teaching skill level, pre-recorded lecture habits, zoom camera etiquette and habits, class community building, exceptions made because of the pandemic, and class attendance changes. These codes were then used to create memos about general themes that were found in the data. These memos were turned into the findings included in the next section. \")]),_c('h2',[_vm._v(\"FINDINGS\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\" Through coding and analysis, four main themes were discovered: separation of spaces, decrease in accountability, widespread zoom burnout, and the varying degrees of virtual participation. \")]),_c('h3',[_vm._v(\"Separation of Spaces\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\" The biggest factor to consider when thinking about the space a pandemic student occupies is how they attempt to create a separation between their “working spaces,” where they are productive and get things done, and their “relaxation spaces,” where they can decompress and rest. Each student had distinct areas in which they relaxed or were productive, but these spaces were manifested in different ways. Gus, for example, has “two chairs: a chair for focused work and a more comfortable chair for gaming and relaxing. The chair that normally faces his monitors is a relaxation chair.” (Gus, 222–223) Gus also has his monitors set up so that “they could very easily be used as a TV with a good view from the bed.” (Gus, 260–261) Kai on the other hand had two tapestries that “seem to serve as a bit of a divider for her bedroom, as they cover all the wall above where the bed touches the wall.” (Kai 217- 219) She also has a galaxy light simulator that sits on her dresser. She likes to turn it on when she is relaxing in bed. (Kai 231–2) Victoria has designated her bed as her relaxation space. Usually, when she is in classes, she tries to stay engaged in a chair with her camera on, but when she is feeling super tired and does not want to participate, she will sit in her bed with her camera off. (Victoria 133–135) Thus, students transformed a place that used to be mainly for relaxation into a space where they spend almost all their time due to the shelter in place orders set by the coronavirus pandemic. \")]),_c('h3',[_vm._v(\"Decrease in Accountability\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\" Students note that although they had distractions during in person classes, the ways in which they are distracted has shifted dramatically with the move to online learning. One student, Travis, noted that he used to fall asleep a fair amount during in person classes (only for a few minutes at a time, sometimes multiple times a day), but since the move to online classes, he finds that he no longer sleeps because he is distracted by a lot more things such as homework for his other classes, Reddit and YouTube. (Travis 64) Travis noted that because he had three monitors, his intense distractions during class was camouflaged. Even when he was not paying very much attention to the class. He slyly claimed, “when I’m looking at other shit going on, [I’m] distracted, but it looks like I’m focusing at the same time. So that’s the beauty of it.” (Travis 160–162) This led Travis to take less notes during online classes. (Travis 168) It is very difficult to gauge productivity and focus when you are looking at a blank square with their name in it, or at a tiny video feed of just their face. The virtual world has fewer physical indicators of focus, and they are hard to see; this creates far less accountability towards actually paying attention in virtual class. Another student, Victoria, noted that in person, she used to not use her phone when she was in smaller classes because she is terrified of authority, but now, during virtual classes, she finds herself using her phone more even in the smaller classes because she “feels there’s way less consequences now.” She also noted that she’s on her phone during class because she wants to be doing anything but learning from home (Victoria 141–147) Although she is more likely to show up to all of her classes because attending class is as simple as clicking a button, she finds that she spends more time on her phone during class. \")]),_c('h3',[_vm._v(\"Zoom Burnout\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\" Each student has different ways of keeping up with their schoolwork and remaining productive while feeling the burnout involved in having entirely virtual classes. Gus gets his motivation from the creation of clean workspaces. When he looks at his desk he thinks, “that is a proper desk” and it motivates him to get work done. (Gus 187–189) Gus also uses a stimulant called nuvigil to help him focus, because he has ADHD (Gus 235). Kai keeps focused by using a pile of small scraps of paper, which she used to keep track of the work that she has due for all her classes. Each slip represents a different class, and she lists the assignments on the lines below.” (Kai 186–189) Despite keeping up with their assignments, student engagement in classes is way down, probably because all classes take place in essentially the same space, a student’s computer, rather than being located in different buildings all across campus as is the case when classes are in person. Not one, but two participants from this study struggled to fully remember their class schedule even though I talked with them during the fifth week of a ten-week quarter, a point where, had the classes been in person their schedules would have been fully memorized. Travis could not list all of the classes he was taking without looking at his canvas page. (Travis 32) Victoria had forgotten about a weekly class meeting because it had been cancelled for the past two weeks for various reasons including election stress and an exam. (Victoria 36–37) This is a clear sign of the burnout that students are facing as online synchronous classes continue to be the only way to attend class during this pandemic. This burnout also occasionally affected class attendance. Victoria, for example, would leave classes prematurely if she felt particularly burned out, due to being stressed out by other things, or if she was having a bad mental health day where she could not stand to be at her computer anymore (Victoria 71–75) If these classes were in person, there would be some motive (and a change of scenery), but in the modern era of virtual learning, it feels like I must sit through it and the phone is a ready distraction to help alleviate the pain and stress of being stuck at your computer for school all day every day (Victoria 149–151). \")]),_c('h3',[_vm._v(\"Decrease in Participation\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\" The consensus for the experiences in online classes is that they are not as interactive, because there are less opportunities to interact with other students. (Travis 62–3) The switch from on campus learning to holding classes entirely though video conferencing software has wrought havoc on class participation. Many students taking online classes never have their camera on, and some only turn it on for short periods of time. In most classes there are typically under five students with their camera on, no matter how large the class is. Yet, in some classes, the only person with their camera on is the professor. For Travis, “sometimes, no one turns their camera on or participates, it’s only me, but in their classes, more people turn the cameras, which is kind of nice.” (Travis 95) Travis stated that “I feel bad for the instructors sometimes when they are staring at a blank board. Sometimes it’s easier to interact and have a productive class session that mimics the tradition classroom experience by having my camera on” (Travis 100–103) For Victoria, in her “smaller classes, it’s me and like one or two other people who will turn on their camera, but most people are willing to participate.” (Victoria, 42–45) This highlights a strange new culture in the classroom, students who are too shy to participate with their video on or to use their voice but are willing to participate through the chat. Victoria finds that although in the main session most cameras are off, “in breakout rooms, most people do turn on their cameras, and I keep mine on. I participate a lot because no one else really does.” (Victoria, 88–91) As people become more accustomed to Zoom (and probably more desperate for social interactions), the culture around Zoom becomes more solidified in the concept that “if you are in a breakout room, you unmute yourself and turn on your camera. And I think that that’s like becoming a little bit more universal and that’s made it easier as well.” (Victoria 128–130) Both Travis and Victoria are motivated to have their camera on for similar reasons, to replicate the real Zoom experience. I find it strange that the two people that I interview seem to have their camera on a lot, yet most students still keep their cameras off for the majority of synchronous classes. Students seem to have two main motivators for participating and focusing during online classes. The first being the fact that it is “still paying full tuition for the classes for basically doing Khan Academy online. So, I might as well get the most of my learning experience.” (Travis, 133–135) The second being out of respect for the professors, because, again, students are paying to be there to learn from these professors.

Normally college life is typically filled with some of the most social interactions in a student’s developmental life. The decrease in social interactions, which impacts student focus, seems to hinge solely on the new limitations of the era: being stuck in your house due to the coronavirus pandemic, as well as the limitations of engagement that video conferencing services provide. These struggles highlight a key area for design improvement: how to make virtual interactions feel more real, and how to encourage student social interaction despite the barriers presented by online learning in the pandemic. This is a huge design opportunity for software industry professionals as they continue to create software and programs that will facilitate face to face interactions despite not being together in person. Some solutions such as Remo aim to mimic the in-person space by creating a bit of an RPG Pokémon-esque experience. This still utilizes video conferencing though which still limits the degree to which you can interact with other people and participants. Based on the truly astounding burnout that students are feeling towards Zoom, as well as the new standards of attending big lectures without your video on, the methods that are based solely on interaction over video camera seem to be a bit naïve.

This research on what is distracting to students, and how students handle their focusing while learning from home, could be vital in making changes and accommodations to current class formats in order to be better suited for the online world.

This study found that focus and learning from home was drastically impacted by four factors: the way in which student separated the space in their home to have distinct areas for study and focus as well as relaxation and decompression, as well as the decrease in accountability that students feel during virtual classes, focusing during class while it is online, changes in what it means to participate in class, and the large effects of zoom burnout.

For most colleges, the\n      Spring of 2020 marked the shift to online learning. Students left campus\n      for spring break and just never came back. Colleges choose to move classes\n      to an entirely virtual platform consisting of both asynchronous and\n      synchronous classes to keep as many people safe as possible from this\n      deadly virus. Many students both asynchronous and synchronous classes in\n      their schedule. The main difference between these two class formats is\n      that synchronous classes have a set time where students and the professor\n      got together in a video conference of some sort, typically Zoom, and have\n      lecture and section live. Asynchronous classes, on the other hand, have no\n      set meeting time and students are given weekly assignments that they\n      complete at their own pace.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      On top of the physical and emotional stress of living through a global\n      pandemic, the shift to virtual learning took a huge portion of the college\n      experience away from students. Instead of physical classes, where students\n      could interact with their fellow classmates before, during, and after\n      class; students now spend countless hours sitting in front of their\n      computers, where the only real social interactions take place in breakout\n      rooms and over class message boards. Starved of the social and physical\n      interactions of normal college life, student morale and mental health is\n      very low, leading to a distinct lack of motivation and productivity. Yet,\n      students are still chugging along towards their degree. This begs the\n      question: how do college students motivate and maintain productivity while\n      learning from home?\n    </p>\n    <h2>RESEARCH SITES AND PARTICIPANTS</h2>\n    <p>\n      This study used convenience sampling to gather four participants: two\n      participants for a field observation, and two participants for an\n      interview study. Gus and Kai were the participants for the field\n      observation, chosen because they were already sharing spaces with me. This\n      allowed me to physically visit the room where they spent their time while\n      taking classes virtually. Victoria and Trevor, on the other hand, were my\n      interview participants. Because the questions in the interview protocol\n      were more geared towards investigating focus and participation and online\n      class, rather than the physical space, it made more sense to do the\n      interviews over Zoom to maintain social distancing guidelines. To fully\n      understand the qualitative data of this study, a description of each\n      participant and their learning from home habitat follows:\n    </p>\n    <h3>Gus Gomer</h3>\n    <p>\n      Gus is a twenty-two-year-old male from Wisconsin who is currently studying\n      engineering at Shoreline Community College. He, like most college students\n      in the state of Washington, is taking classes entirely online due to the\n      Coronavirus pandemic. He has ADHD and is really struggling to focus on his\n      classes while learning from home, especially since all of his classes are\n      entirely asynchronous. He shares a “cheaply built” house with three other\n      roommates and a dog. Gus has a spacious square room on the right side of\n      the second floor of his house directly above the kitchen. Any time someone\n      does anything in the kitchen, Gus can hear it. Out of the three roommates,\n      one of them is addicted to heroin. Because of this, the dynamics in the\n      house are quite strange and can be quite distracting when Gus is trying to\n      get schoolwork done. As you peer into the room from the doorway, your eye\n      is drawn to the floor in front of the wall on the right side of the room,\n      where almost every inch is covered in car parts, trash, clothing, and\n      other random small items. After the wall of clutter, the next thing you\n      notice about the room is his desk. It is a large industrial table made\n      from planks of pine and steel. He built the desk/table himself using\n      welding and power tools. He also built the table top himself and stained\n      it with a dark color. Then, against the adjacent wall, there is a dresser,\n      a side table and a bed. Finally, the wall behind the desk is a lot of\n      shelving. It looks like it was supposed to be hidden behind a closet, but\n      the construction just never got there.\n    </p>\n    <h3>Kai Sanders</h3>\n    <p>\n      Kai lives with her roommate in the bottom unit of a two-story house in\n      Seattle located two blocks away from the highway and approximately seven\n      blocks away from the University of Washington — Seattle Campus. Kai lives\n      in the back room of their garden apartment in the larger room. Kai’s room\n      is right next to the kitchen and looks out into the backyard. Before\n      entering Kai’s room, you notice a young man with a beard sitting at the\n      kitchen table in the common space in her apartment, her boyfriend. He is\n      sitting on a wooden chair, looking at a laptop. He also has a couple of\n      notebooks and papers strewn across the table. They have been together\n      since the end of their freshman year together. They had meet in a First\n      Year Interest Group (FIG) an introductory class and scholarly friendship\n      making sort of class. He had apparently spent the past two nights at her\n      apartment and was doing his own schoolwork at the Kitchen table, while Kai\n      worked on her own schoolwork in her own room (he is an engineering student\n      at the University of Washington). Occasionally, during the observational\n      interview, we would hear a couple of soft-spoken words coming from outside\n      the room, which were the sounds of her boyfriend participating in his own\n      classes in the next room. Looking into her room, from the doorway, you\n      first see her desk, which is off to the right side of the door. The desk\n      is an average size for a college student. To the left of her desk, there\n      is a closet with no doors. Her closet has a bar with hangers and clothing\n      hanging from it. The number of clothes she has hanging from the bar is\n      minimal, with a fair number of bare hangers on the bar. On the next two\n      walls there are two tapestries. Directly below the tapestries, she has\n      placed her queen-sized bed in is it the right corner in the back of her\n      room. Next to the bed is a side table and then a laundry bag. On the final\n      wall there is a large dresser with a mirror sitting on top of it.\n    </p>\n    <h3>Victoria Anderson</h3>\n    <p>\n      Victoria is a junior studying Human Centered Design and Engineering (HCDE)\n      at the University of Washington Seattle. She really likes design and wants\n      to be able to make an impact on her community through her design work. She\n      is taking 17 credits in the form of four classes and one directed research\n      group. She is taking: a synchronous python class, a synchronous technical\n      writing class, a synchronous organization teamwork class, and an\n      asynchronous anthropology class with a synchronous labs section. Our\n      meeting took place over Zoom, a video conferencing platform, which means\n      that we were chatting from two separate rooms. I was sitting in my living\n      room, on the floor in front of my couch, while Victoria joined me from her\n      bedroom on her bed. She lives in the house for her sorority with six other\n      female UW students studying engineering. She has luscious blue walls that\n      are tilted in a way that makes it look like she has an attic room. Along\n      the wall there are four small mirror tiles hanging as well as a map\n      poster. She was seated on her bed for the duration of the interview. The\n      interview took place on a sunny Saturday at around 2PM, during a one-hour\n      break between two sessions for a virtual conference for an engineering\n      ambassador program that we had both been participating in.\n    </p>\n    <h3>Travis Argo</h3>\n    <p>\n      Travis is a junior studying Human Centered Design and Engineering (HCDE)\n      at the University of Washington Seattle. He is taking 14 credits through\n      four classes. He is taking an asynchronous class about data and society, a\n      synchronous class about physical prototyping, a synchronous python class,\n      and a synchronous seminar about getting a job in the field of computer\n      science. Our interview took place over Zoom at around 4pm on a Monday,\n      after one of the classes we had together, and were chatting from two\n      separate environments. I was joining the video from my computer desk in my\n      Seattle apartment, while he attended the interview from his family home in\n      South Seattle. He was sitting at his computer desk, which had three\n      monitors set up on it. Behind him, there was a window with long curtains\n      that were tried at about window height to keep the curtains off the floor.\n      Adjacent to the wall with the window on it, there was a tall bookshelf.\n      Next to the bookshelf there was a large bulky light, which looked like it\n      belonged in a fish tank, and perhaps may have in fact ben from a fish\n      tank, that gave off blue light. He was sitting in a rolling desk chair\n      that looked about mid-range as far as desk chair quality goes. He had a\n      pillow wedged between his back and the chair back, which means he was\n      probably getting a little bit uncomfortable from sitting all day. He also\n      has a light that gives off blue light next to that bookshelf. He has a\n      pillow on his chair behind him back. His bed is to the right side of the\n      window, but you cannot see it in the camera. During the pandemic, he\n      re-arranged his space. At the start of the pandemic, he had a large bulky\n      bookshelf on the wall adjacent to the windows, where there is now the blue\n      light. When he does not want to attend class with his video on, he will\n      cover his web camera with a post it notes and set a virtual background to\n      an image that make it look like he is paying attention. The thing is,\n      there virtual background pictures were all taken while the bookshelf was\n      still there, so when he turns this fake virtual background off, it looks\n      like the big bookshelf moved. Not many people notice this discrepancy\n      though.\n    </p>\n    <h2>METHODS</h2>\n    <p>\n      This study consisted of two field observations as well as two interviews.\n      Each field observation had the same main goal of understanding how\n      students set up their rooms, a space where they are now spending almost\n      all their time due to the shift that made classes entirely virtual.\n      Because Gus was the only entirely asynchronous student in this sample and\n      he was uncomfortable with me observing him while working asynchronously, I\n      was only able to conduct a basic observation about the space he takes his\n      asynchronous classes from. This included quiet observation of the room, as\n      well asking him a couple of questions about specific items and oddities I\n      noticed. During this observation, I sat on Gus’s desk chair which had been\n      made from an old car seat, to get a basic understanding of his space. Kai,\n      on the other hand had synchronous classes, which allowed me to sit in and\n      observe her while she was in a quiz section. Kai’s observation began with\n      a general overview of the space she was in, while Kai waited for class to\n      start. Then, when her class did not begin on time, because her quiz\n      section TA did not show up, the observation switched to watching her as\n      she tried to figure out where to attend/watch class another way. During\n      this observation, I sat on her bed and mostly stayed out of the way,\n      asking an occasional clarification question. Although the flow for each\n      observation was slightly different, the field notes were taken in a\n      similar fashion. While observing I took jottings and short notes in a pink\n      a4 notebook. Beside me, I had my stopwatch running, so that I could mark\n      the time approximately every 5 minutes to understand the ebb and flow of\n      these observations. Then, I translated the jottings into ethnographic\n      field notes.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Unlike the two unique field observations, the two interviews followed the\n      same semi structured interview protocol. These interviews took place over\n      Zoom and were recorded using their cloud recording feature. The interview\n      consisted of questions based in four sections. It began with questions\n      about college students including questions about what the student is\n      studying, college year, number of credits, as well as their goals and\n      motivations. Next, there were questions about synchronous classes\n      including background information about the format of the online classes,\n      the benefits and drawbacks, and stories from their virtual classroom\n      experience. It then transitioned into more details about attending virtual\n      classes including descriptions of what it looks like to attend virtual\n      class for each student, signals and prompts that cause a student to engage\n      or participate in class, and how the expert ace of class hand change with\n      the switch to online classes. We concluded the interview by discussing how\n      students focused in virtual class including recounting times when they\n      have felt both focused and unfocused, changes in focus with the switch to\n      online classes, what type of distractions they encounter, and what the\n      biggest obstacles to focus have been. After each interview, I read through\n      the transcripts and made them readable, so that they would be ready for\n      analysis.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Using a modified grounded theory approach, I began my data analysis. Using\n      my research question “how do college students motivate and maintain\n      productivity while learning from home?” as a guiding light, I read through\n      my observational field notes from Kai and Gus as well as my interview\n      transcripts from Travis and Victoria and began to make codes. I ended up\n      with codes in three main categories, each with a set of subcodes. First\n      there is the General details about participants and their space which\n      consists of the codes: workstation detail, class detail, participants\n      background, work versus relax areas. Second there is focus (or lack\n      thereof) and meeting class goals, which consists of the codes: methods of\n      focus, mental barrier to focus, accountability for getting work done,\n      distraction from focus, feelings about being distracted. Finally, there is\n      virtual classroom culture and how it differs from in person, which\n      consists of the codes: participation, breakout room variation, technical\n      difficulties, frustration, online teaching skill level, pre-recorded\n      lecture habits, zoom camera etiquette and habits, class community\n      building, exceptions made because of the pandemic, and class attendance\n      changes. These codes were then used to create memos about general themes\n      that were found in the data. These memos were turned into the findings\n      included in the next section.\n    </p>\n    <h2>FINDINGS</h2>\n    <p>\n      Through coding and analysis, four main themes were discovered: separation\n      of spaces, decrease in accountability, widespread zoom burnout, and the\n      varying degrees of virtual participation.\n    </p>\n    <h3>Separation of Spaces</h3>\n    <p>\n      The biggest factor to consider when thinking about the space a pandemic\n      student occupies is how they attempt to create a separation between their\n      “working spaces,” where they are productive and get things done, and their\n      “relaxation spaces,” where they can decompress and rest. Each student had\n      distinct areas in which they relaxed or were productive, but these spaces\n      were manifested in different ways. Gus, for example, has “two chairs: a\n      chair for focused work and a more comfortable chair for gaming and\n      relaxing. The chair that normally faces his monitors is a relaxation\n      chair.” (Gus, 222–223) Gus also has his monitors set up so that “they\n      could very easily be used as a TV with a good view from the bed.” (Gus,\n      260–261) Kai on the other hand had two tapestries that “seem to serve as a\n      bit of a divider for her bedroom, as they cover all the wall above where\n      the bed touches the wall.” (Kai 217- 219) She also has a galaxy light\n      simulator that sits on her dresser. She likes to turn it on when she is\n      relaxing in bed. (Kai 231–2) Victoria has designated her bed as her\n      relaxation space. Usually, when she is in classes, she tries to stay\n      engaged in a chair with her camera on, but when she is feeling super tired\n      and does not want to participate, she will sit in her bed with her camera\n      off. (Victoria 133–135) Thus, students transformed a place that used to be\n      mainly for relaxation into a space where they spend almost all their time\n      due to the shelter in place orders set by the coronavirus pandemic.\n    </p>\n    <h3>Decrease in Accountability</h3>\n    <p>\n      Students note that although they had distractions during in person\n      classes, the ways in which they are distracted has shifted dramatically\n      with the move to online learning. One student, Travis, noted that he used\n      to fall asleep a fair amount during in person classes (only for a few\n      minutes at a time, sometimes multiple times a day), but since the move to\n      online classes, he finds that he no longer sleeps because he is distracted\n      by a lot more things such as homework for his other classes, Reddit and\n      YouTube. (Travis 64) Travis noted that because he had three monitors, his\n      intense distractions during class was camouflaged. Even when he was not\n      paying very much attention to the class. He slyly claimed, “when I’m\n      looking at other shit going on, [I’m] distracted, but it looks like I’m\n      focusing at the same time. So that’s the beauty of it.” (Travis 160–162)\n      This led Travis to take less notes during online classes. (Travis 168) It\n      is very difficult to gauge productivity and focus when you are looking at\n      a blank square with their name in it, or at a tiny video feed of just\n      their face. The virtual world has fewer physical indicators of focus, and\n      they are hard to see; this creates far less accountability towards\n      actually paying attention in virtual class. Another student, Victoria,\n      noted that in person, she used to not use her phone when she was in\n      smaller classes because she is terrified of authority, but now, during\n      virtual classes, she finds herself using her phone more even in the\n      smaller classes because she “feels there’s way less consequences now.” She\n      also noted that she’s on her phone during class because she wants to be\n      doing anything but learning from home (Victoria 141–147) Although she is\n      more likely to show up to all of her classes because attending class is as\n      simple as clicking a button, she finds that she spends more time on her\n      phone during class.\n    </p>\n    <h3>Zoom Burnout</h3>\n    <p>\n      Each student has different ways of keeping up with their schoolwork and\n      remaining productive while feeling the burnout involved in having entirely\n      virtual classes. Gus gets his motivation from the creation of clean\n      workspaces. When he looks at his desk he thinks, “that is a proper desk”\n      and it motivates him to get work done. (Gus 187–189) Gus also uses a\n      stimulant called nuvigil to help him focus, because he has ADHD (Gus 235).\n      Kai keeps focused by using a pile of small scraps of paper, which she used\n      to keep track of the work that she has due for all her classes. Each slip\n      represents a different class, and she lists the assignments on the lines\n      below.” (Kai 186–189) Despite keeping up with their assignments, student\n      engagement in classes is way down, probably because all classes take place\n      in essentially the same space, a student’s computer, rather than being\n      located in different buildings all across campus as is the case when\n      classes are in person. Not one, but two participants from this study\n      struggled to fully remember their class schedule even though I talked with\n      them during the fifth week of a ten-week quarter, a point where, had the\n      classes been in person their schedules would have been fully memorized.\n      Travis could not list all of the classes he was taking without looking at\n      his canvas page. (Travis 32) Victoria had forgotten about a weekly class\n      meeting because it had been cancelled for the past two weeks for various\n      reasons including election stress and an exam. (Victoria 36–37) This is a\n      clear sign of the burnout that students are facing as online synchronous\n      classes continue to be the only way to attend class during this pandemic.\n      This burnout also occasionally affected class attendance. Victoria, for\n      example, would leave classes prematurely if she felt particularly burned\n      out, due to being stressed out by other things, or if she was having a bad\n      mental health day where she could not stand to be at her computer anymore\n      (Victoria 71–75) If these classes were in person, there would be some\n      motive (and a change of scenery), but in the modern era of virtual\n      learning, it feels like I must sit through it and the phone is a ready\n      distraction to help alleviate the pain and stress of being stuck at your\n      computer for school all day every day (Victoria 149–151).\n    </p>\n    <h3>Decrease in Participation</h3>\n    <p>\n      The consensus for the experiences in online classes is that they are not\n      as interactive, because there are less opportunities to interact with\n      other students. (Travis 62–3) The switch from on campus learning to\n      holding classes entirely though video conferencing software has wrought\n      havoc on class participation. Many students taking online classes never\n      have their camera on, and some only turn it on for short periods of time.\n      In most classes there are typically under five students with their camera\n      on, no matter how large the class is. Yet, in some classes, the only\n      person with their camera on is the professor. For Travis, “sometimes, no\n      one turns their camera on or participates, it’s only me, but in their\n      classes, more people turn the cameras, which is kind of nice.” (Travis 95)\n      Travis stated that “I feel bad for the instructors sometimes when they are\n      staring at a blank board. Sometimes it’s easier to interact and have a\n      productive class session that mimics the tradition classroom experience by\n      having my camera on” (Travis 100–103) For Victoria, in her “smaller\n      classes, it’s me and like one or two other people who will turn on their\n      camera, but most people are willing to participate.” (Victoria, 42–45)\n      This highlights a strange new culture in the classroom, students who are\n      too shy to participate with their video on or to use their voice but are\n      willing to participate through the chat. Victoria finds that although in\n      the main session most cameras are off, “in breakout rooms, most people do\n      turn on their cameras, and I keep mine on. I participate a lot because no\n      one else really does.” (Victoria, 88–91) As people become more accustomed\n      to Zoom (and probably more desperate for social interactions), the culture\n      around Zoom becomes more solidified in the concept that “if you are in a\n      breakout room, you unmute yourself and turn on your camera. And I think\n      that that’s like becoming a little bit more universal and that’s made it\n      easier as well.” (Victoria 128–130) Both Travis and Victoria are motivated\n      to have their camera on for similar reasons, to replicate the real Zoom\n      experience. I find it strange that the two people that I interview seem to\n      have their camera on a lot, yet most students still keep their cameras off\n      for the majority of synchronous classes. Students seem to have two main\n      motivators for participating and focusing during online classes. The first\n      being the fact that it is “still paying full tuition for the classes for\n      basically doing Khan Academy online. So, I might as well get the most of\n      my learning experience.” (Travis, 133–135) The second being out of respect\n      for the professors, because, again, students are paying to be there to\n      learn from these professors. (Victoria 54)\n    </p>\n    <h2>DESIGN IMPLICATIONS</h2>\n    <p>\n      More than anything, the findings of this study show how truly desolate the\n      social arena looks for college students during the pandemic. Normally\n      college life is typically filled with some of the most social interactions\n      in a student’s developmental life. The decrease in social interactions,\n      which impacts student focus, seems to hinge solely on the new limitations\n      of the era: being stuck in your house due to the coronavirus pandemic, as\n      well as the limitations of engagement that video conferencing services\n      provide. These struggles highlight a key area for design improvement: how\n      to make virtual interactions feel more real, and how to encourage student\n      social interaction despite the barriers presented by online learning in\n      the pandemic. This is a huge design opportunity for software industry\n      professionals as they continue to create software and programs that will\n      facilitate face to face interactions despite not being together in person.\n      Some solutions such as Remo aim to mimic the in-person space by creating a\n      bit of an RPG Pokémon-esque experience. This still utilizes video\n      conferencing though which still limits the degree to which you can\n      interact with other people and participants. Based on the truly astounding\n      burnout that students are feeling towards Zoom, as well as the new\n      standards of attending big lectures without your video on, the methods\n      that are based solely on interaction over video camera seem to be a bit\n      naïve. By understanding student focus participation and distraction,\n      engineers can attempt to build classroom environments for better focusing\n      for students.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      This research could also be used to inform the creation of curricula for\n      future online classes, because it is very apparent that we probably will\n      not be back together on campus until at least spring quarter 2021, but\n      more realistically, students will not be back on campus until the fall of\n      2021. This research on what is distracting to students, and how students\n      handle their focusing while learning from home, could be vital in making\n      changes and accommodations to current class formats in order to be better\n      suited for the online world. This could be through changing the class\n      format from asynchronous to synchronous, changing the type of projects and\n      assessments being given to students, and changing the way that students\n      interact, or even by creating new methods and forums for class\n      participation.\n    </p>\n    <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n    <p>\n      The swift and disruptive changes that rocked the world at the start of the\n      novel coronavirus Pandemic had caused intense drastic change in the way\n      that college students attend class. Students moved from in person classes\n      to virtual classes to taking either asynchronous classes or synchronous\n      classes online from their home. Starved of the social and physical\n      interactions of normal college life, student morale and mental health is\n      very low, yet students are still chugging along towards their degree,\n      which led the study to explore this question: how do college students\n      motivate and maintain productivity while learning from home? This study\n      found that focus and learning from home was drastically impacted by four\n      factors: the way in which student separated the space in their home to\n      have distinct areas for study and focus as well as relaxation and\n      decompression, as well as the decrease in accountability that students\n      feel during virtual classes, focusing during class while it is online,\n      changes in what it means to participate in class, and the large effects of\n      zoom burnout. These barriers to focus seem to hinge on the new limitations\n      of the era: being stuck in your house due to the coronavirus pandemic, as\n      well as the limitations of engagement that video conferencing services\n      provide.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The biggest limiting factor of this study is the small sample size. These\n      limited results make the overarching results of this study less\n      generalizable. This study may also have been slightly limited using Zoom\n      as my main platform for interviewing, especially because the physical\n      space seems to have a large impact on the productivity of a student while\n      learning from home. Although I am content with my research question, in\n      further iterations of this study, my interview protocol would contain more\n      questions about the separation of space. Because way that space is divided\n      seemed to have a very large impact on mental health, which is a huge\n      factor in pandemic focus. I would also increase the number of participants\n      and solidify the field observation protocol so that it is only while the\n      student is getting work done for a particular class.\n    </p>\n    <h2>ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTS</h2>\n    <ul>\n      <li><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-OrVFr3Gy8ltkjtzftkSwbXR4_DasHBhTi-51Rt4-R0/edit#gid=0\" target=\"_blank\">Codebook</a></li>\n      <li><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vYlTVYClcIQo1Goxh9k9lS0Lnpv08uow/view\" target=\"_blank\">Travis Interview Transcript</a></li>\n      <li><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/19_3N_A1Be8cC-FvImviwk0V-F224OIYv/view\" target=\"_blank\">Victoria Interview Transcript</a></li>\n      <li><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lTL56eAq9LaKlvXTP2EqiCoYPvAP9_kr/view\" target=\"_blank\">Gus Observation Field Notes</a></li>\n      <li><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ot7GZp_TIWPVzKMnI1_mj2Xi12gfOZSI/view\" target=\"_blank\">Kai Observation Field Notes</a></li>\n      <li><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uvzPlP1w6cx2eboPBsJWAdNznIDPaail/view\" target=\"_blank\">The Final Report</a></li>\n    </ul>\n     <div class=\"d-flex flex-column flex-md-row text-center justify-content-between\">\n        <router-link to=\"/nature\"><b>Previous Project: </b> Access to Nature and Crime</router-link> \n        </div>\n  </PortfolioPiece>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nimport PortfolioPiece from \"@/components/layouts/PortfolioPiece.vue\";\n\nexport default {\n  components: {\n    PortfolioPiece,\n  },\n};\n</script>\n","import mod from \"-!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--13-0!../../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--1-0!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./zoom-u.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"; export default mod; export * from \"-!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--13-0!../../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--1-0!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./zoom-u.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"","import { render, staticRenderFns } from \"./zoom-u.vue?vue&type=template&id=3a7e3d8e&\"\nimport script from \"./zoom-u.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\nexport * from \"./zoom-u.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\n\n\n/* normalize component */\nimport normalizer from \"!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/runtime/componentNormalizer.js\"\nvar component = normalizer(\n  script,\n  render,\n  staticRenderFns,\n  false,\n  null,\n  null,\n  null\n  \n)\n\nexport default component.exports","var render = function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _c('WithNav',[_c('div',{staticClass:\"cow d-flex justify-content-around align-items-center align-items-lg-center\\n      mt-5 mt-lg-0\"},[_c('div',{staticClass:\"\\n        d-flex\\n        justify-content-around\\n        align-items-center\\n        flex-column flex-lg-row\\n      \"},[_c('div',{staticClass:\"cow small d-flex justify-content-center align-items-center\",style:({ 'background-image': 'url(assets/vertical-swoop.png)' }),attrs:{\"id\":\"img\"}},[_c('img',{staticClass:\"image rounded-circle\",attrs:{\"src\":\"assets/val.jpeg\",\"alt\":\"A blonde girl standing in front of a colorful wall\"}})]),_c('img',{staticClass:\"image rounded-circle mt-5\",attrs:{\"id\":\"mobile\",\"src\":\"assets/val.jpeg\",\"alt\":\"A blonde girl standing in front of a colorful wall\"}}),_c('div',{staticClass:\"large\",attrs:{\"id\":\"text-box\"}},[_c('div',{attrs:{\"id\":\"text\"}},[_c('h1',{staticClass:\"pt-0\"},[_vm._v(\"It's nice to meet you!\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\" I'm Valerie Remaker and I graduated from The University of Washington pursuing a double degree in Human Centered Design and Engineering (HCDE) and Psychology.

In the department of psychology, I helped collect data\n              for a Virtual Reality study which investigated participants'\n              reaction to different levels of immersion into simulated natural\n              environments.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              In my free-time I love to crochet and enjoy the natural world.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </WithNav>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nimport WithNav from \"@/components/layouts/WithNav.vue\";\n\nexport default {\n  components: {\n    WithNav,\n  },\n  data() {\n    return {\n      width: window.innerWidth,\n    };\n  },\n  created() {\n    window.addEventListener(\"resize\", this.yo);\n  },\n  destroyed() {\n    window.removeEventListener(\"resize\", this.yo);\n  },\n  mounted() {\n    if (window.innerWidth < 992) {\n      document.querySelector(\"#img\").classList.add(\"hidden\");\n      document.querySelector(\"#mobile\").classList.remove(\"hidden\");\n      document.querySelector(\"#text-box\").classList.remove(\"large\");\n    } else {\n      document.querySelector(\"#img\").classList.remove(\"hidden\");\n      document.querySelector(\"#mobile\").classList.add(\"hidden\");\n      document.querySelector(\"#text-box\").classList.add(\"large\");\n    }\n  },\n  methods: {\n    yo(e) {\n      if (window.innerWidth < 992) {\n        document.querySelector(\"#img\").classList.add(\"hidden\");\n        document.querySelector(\"#mobile\").classList.remove(\"hidden\");\n        document.querySelector(\"#text-box\").classList.remove(\"large\");\n      } else {\n        document.querySelector(\"#img\").classList.remove(\"hidden\");\n        document.querySelector(\"#mobile\").classList.add(\"hidden\");\n        document.querySelector(\"#text-box\").classList.add(\"large\");\n      }\n    },\n  },\n};\n</script>\n<style scoped>\n\n.hidden {\n  display: none !important;\n}\n</style>\n","import mod from \"-!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--13-0!../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--1-0!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./About.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"; export default mod; export * from \"-!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--13-0!../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--1-0!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./About.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"","import { render, staticRenderFns } from \"./About.vue?vue&type=template&id=6ec9bcd6&scoped=true&\"\nimport script from \"./About.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\nexport * from \"./About.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\nimport style0 from \"./About.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&id=6ec9bcd6&scoped=true&lang=css&\"\n\n\n/* normalize component */\nimport normalizer from \"!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/runtime/componentNormalizer.js\"\nvar component = normalizer(\n  script,\n  render,\n  staticRenderFns,\n  false,\n  null,\n  \"6ec9bcd6\",\n  null\n  \n)\n\nexport default component.exports","var render = function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _c('PortfolioPiece',[_c('div',{staticClass:\"title\"},[_c('h1',[_vm._v(\"Common Ground\")]),_c('p',{staticClass:\"subhead\"},[_vm._v(\"People Over Politics\")]),_c('hr')]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\" For the 2020 HCDE Democracy Design Jam, a 24 hour virtual design sprint, my team wondered: In a country divided by politics and physical isolation, how can people connect and find common ground with each other?
