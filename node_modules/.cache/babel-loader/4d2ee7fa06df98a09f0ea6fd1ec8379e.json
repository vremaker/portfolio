Literacy</h1>\n        <p>\n          Empowering users to gain financial literacy skills that are applicable\n          to their lives using their real financial data.\n        </p>\n        <hr />\n      </div>\n    <!--</div>-->\n    <p>\n      For the final project of my Human Centered Design and Engineering degree,\n      my capstone team designed a financial literacy learning platform for\n      Chime, a financial technology company that offers credit and debit cards.\n      During our initial stakeholder meeting with Chime, we learned that their\n      users know what they have, but feel they can’t build wealth. So, we\n      decided to focus our solution on users living paycheck to paycheck, which\n      we defined as those who make under $75,000 a year. Over the course of 6\n      months, our team planned, researched, and designed a financial literacy\n      application that draws upon users own finances as a baseline for their\n      learning experience.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      To motivate our design process, we used began by developing the following\n      research and design questions:\n    </p>\n    <b>Research Questions:</b>\n    <ul>\n      <li>What categories of financial literacy are most useful to users?</li>\n      <li>What does financial literacy mean to users?</li>\n      <li>What is the easiest way for someone to build wealth?</li>\n      <li>How do you move from paycheck-to-paycheck to accumulate wealth?</li>\n      <li>\n        What are the differences in the knowledge base between those who have\n        financial literacy and those who do not?\n      </li>\n      <li>Why are users motivated to learn about finances?</li>\n      <li>\n        What are the most effective ways to engage users on financial literacy?\n      </li>\n      <li>How do people avoid and escape debt?</li>\n    </ul>\n    <b>Design Questions: </b>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        How can we make financial literacy education more quick, fun, and\n        accessible and help build individuals’ wealth?\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Do we design financial literacy education within users’ finance tools or\n        outside of it?\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n\n    <h2>User Research</h2>\n    <p>\n      To begin, we conducted several rounds of user research. We conducted\n      secondary research, a survey, and interviews. Then, we created personas\n      and user journey maps to guide our design process.\n    </p>\n    <h3>Secondary Research</h3>\n    <p>\n      To gain an understanding of the current solutions within the problem\n      space, we conducted both an audit of Chime and a Competitive analysis of\n      current solutions in the financial literacy and education space. Our\n      findings are presented below.\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"d-flex flex-lg-row flex-column justify-content-between\">\n      <div class=\"horiz\">\n        <p class=\"c\">Chime Audit</p>\n        <img\n          class=\"chart\"\n          src=\"assets/fin-lit/chime_audit.png\"\n          alt=\"chart to describe findings of our Chime Audit\"\n        />\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"horiz\">\n        <p class=\"c\">Competitive Analysis</p>\n        <img\n          class=\"chart\"\n          src=\"assets/fin-lit/competitive_analysis.png\"\n          alt=\"chart that describes findings of our Competitive Analysis\"\n        />\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <br />\n    <p>\n      Our Chime audit highlighted the limited scope of financial literacy tools\n      provided by Chime in which the educational material available was\n      presented in long form articles that were hard to parse.

Initially, we intended\n      for both Mark and Laura to be primary users, but during our research, we\n      noticed that a lot of the pain points for our older and younger users were\n      similar. After a meeting with our stakeholders, we decided to focus our\n      design in intervening earlier so that the newer users don't make the same\n      mistakes as their older counterparts. Because our focus was on Mark, we\n      decided to focus a large portion of our design motivation around the goal\n      of understanding and paying off student debt.\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"d-flex flex-column justify-content-between\">\n      <div class=\"horiz\">\n        <img src=\"assets/fin-lit/mark.png\" alt=\"Mark Persona\" />\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"horiz\">\n        <img src=\"assets/fin-lit/laura.png\" alt=\"Laura Persona\" />\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <h3>User Journey Maps</h3>\n    <p>\n      After creating personas, we made two user journey maps to highlight the\n      experiences that our users have with financial literacy. Mark's journey\n      map has a huge focus on social media financial literacy, advice from\n      parents, and stress about money along with a lack of understanding of how\n      credit and debit work. Laura's journey has a focus on providing for her\n      family, gaining skills to make money, protecting her finances from\n      overdraft fees, and getting advice from her bank about her finances.\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"d-flex flex-lg-row flex-column justify-content-between\">\n      <div class=\"horiz\">\n        <img src=\"assets/fin-lit/mark_jm.png\" alt=\"Mark Map\" />\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"horiz\">\n        <img src=\"assets/fin-lit/laura_jm.png\" alt=\"Laura Map\" />\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <h2>Ideation</h2>\n    <p>\n      After our user research, we began to create problem statements and design\n      goals to center our ideation.\n    </p>\n    <b>Problem Statements</b>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        Users often feel overwhelmed, lost, or intimidated knowing how to start\n        learning about finances\n      </li>\n      <li>Users lack the motivation to practice financial literacy</li>\n      <li>\n        Financial practices like 401k or savings are abstract and can be\n        difficult for users to visualize the benefits\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Users are given advice that is not impactful to their current experience\n        and suffers from \"shouldism\" for example \"I should be investing\" or \"I\n        should be in crypto\"\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n    <b>Design Goals</b>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        Balance giving the user impactful knowledge, but also allowing them to\n        explore various financial interests. We call this Free-range design vs.\n        Paternal design.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Leave users feeling confident in their financial knowledge and the\n        progress they are making in their learning\n      </li>\n      <li>Provide valuable information to help them here and now</li>\n      <li>\n        Clearly present information that is valuable to them using visual\n        representations\n      </li>\n      <li>Create a trusting and nonjudgemental learning environment</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>\n      After coming together to create these design goals, it was time to start\n      generating ideas about what tools might be helpful in the creation of a\n      financial literacy application. To address this, we went through several\n      design activities to scope out our solution space, this involved: crazy\n      8's, storyboarding, and the creation of workflows.\n    </p>\n    <h3>Crazy 8's</h3>\n    <p>\n      To begin our ideation, we wanted to generate as many ideas a possible by\n      doing crazy 8s. We each quickly sketched 8 screens on our own, and then\n      posted our work in the team FigJam. We then divided up each crazy-8's\n      document into individual screens and grouped the screens based on\n      functionality to decide where the team had the most overlap in their\n      ideation through the categories: onboarding, progress dashboard, learning\n      simulation, lesson layout, testing content, resource locators, resource\n      helpers, and financial calculators. With this overview of ideas, we then\n      entered the storyboarding phase, in which we took these ideas and thought\n      about what those might look like for our users.\n    </p>\n    <img src=\"assets/fin-lit/crazy8.png\" alt=\"crazy 8s\" />\n    <h3>Storyboards</h3>\n    <p>\n      Following our crazy 8's and a review of user research from previous weeks,\n      we created storyboards to explore how potential problem-solving ideas\n      would be accessed by our personas.\n    </p>\n    <img src=\"assets/fin-lit/storyboards.png\" alt=\"storyboards\" />\n    <p>\n      <b>Results:</b>\n      Storyboarding helped us identify how we can fit key features into an app\n      format. It also helped us imagine when and where users would need these\n      features. This gave us some direction in our Information Architecture,\n      helping us decide which ideated features to include, as well as in what\n      order these features should appear in our application's hierarchy.\n    </p>\n    <h3>User Workflows</h3>\n    <p>\n      We began our wireframes with the design kit created by Chime. For this\n      first iteration, we focused on onboarding processes, knowledge checks and\n      lesson plans. The workflow diagrams served as the blueprint for our\n      wireframes. However, as we prototyped more and discussed as a group, we\n      later changed certain aspects of our design. Critiquing the workflow\n      diagrams as a group led us to refine ideas more and to decide which ideas\n      were supported by our codebook and persona's needs.\n    </p>\n    <img src=\"assets/fin-lit/workflow.png\" alt=\"storyboards\" />\n    <h2>Design and Iteration</h2>\n    <p>\n      In the design of our final application, we went through three rounds of\n      iteration, which are highlighted below.

One of the\n      biggest areas for growth that we came across in our end product was the\n      quality and depth of the lessons. To better develop these lessons and\n      ideas, an important next step would be to focus on UX writing and content\n      strategy to more effectively present the financial literacy content to our\n      users. Although the content we present is helpful, it may not be portrayed\n      in the cleanest way, and there is definitely room for improvement.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      We also ended the project with a user testing session. Although we got\n      decent reviews from our users, there was still a large amount of feedback\n      which would help us improve our application. I am most excited about the\n      inclusion of how much money has been put towards your goal at the top of\n      the goal details page to show how much progress has been made towards the\n      goal to motivate the user to make more progress towards their goals. There\n      were improvements to be made to the lessons within our application.\n      Although the content was solid, the layout could use more reworking. We\n      would add more color and engagement factors within the application, and\n      would work to make the screens full of less text.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      If we were continued with this project, we would also want to create more\n      screens and flows for our user's learning experience such as the\n      prototyping out the savings flow, budgeting flow, custom goal flow, and\n      more content for the lessons that are available in the skill builder\n      section. We then, obviously, would perform more user testing and\n      iterations upon our product with users who are working paycheck to\n      paycheck.\n    </p>\n    <h2>Reflection</h2>\n    <p>\n      This capstone project was a great experience. I was worried at the start\n      of this project to be designing for financial literacy when I really did\n      not know very much about financial literacy myself. During our interview\n      process, our intended user groups had just about as much financial\n      literacy awareness as we did. One of the biggest barriers, especially\n      among the college students, was the lack of stable income as a student.\n      Our interviews with the older generation of users, had similar insights\n      about what happens when you neglect financial literacy, and it also gave\n      me insight into the pains associated with debt, especially for those in\n      lower incomes. It was in our interview with the financial professor at UW\n      that we were able to start to learn financial literacy, which was a key\n      facet to having successful designs. Personally, I talked to my dad about\n      financial literacy for the first time during this project. He seemed\n      really excited that I was interested in learning financial literacy, and\n      I'm grateful that this project allowed me to increase my financial\n      literacy skills. It also motivated me to continue my own financial\n      literacy journey after this project is complete.\n    </p>\n\n    <div\n      class=\"\n        d-flex\n        flex-column flex-md-row\n        text-center\n        justify-content-center justify-content-lg-end\n      \"\n    >\n      <router-link to=\"/on-trak\"\n        ><b>Next Project: </b>OnTrak Troubleshooting</router-link\n      >\n    </div>\n  </PortfolioPiece>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nimport PortfolioPiece from \"@/components/layouts/PortfolioPiece.vue\";\n\nexport default {\n  components: {\n    PortfolioPiece,\n  },\n};\n</script>\n<style scoped style=\"scss\">\n.chart {\n  padding: 0;\n}\n/*\n.horiz {\n  display: flex;\n  flex-flow: column;\n  width: 49%;\n}*/\n@media screen and (max-width: 992px) {\n  .horiz {\n    display: flex;\n    flex-flow: column;\n    width: 100%;\n    padding-bottom: 10px;\n  }\n}\n\n.c {\n  text-align: center;\n  font-weight: bold;\n  margin-bottom: 5px;\n}\n\n.screen {\n  display: block;\n  width: 80%;\n  margin: auto;\n}\n</style>"],"sourceRoot":"src/views/portfolio"}]}
