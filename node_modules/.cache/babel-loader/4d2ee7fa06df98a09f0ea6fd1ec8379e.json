<h1>Chime Financial Literacy</h1>\n      <p class=\"subhead\">\n        Using real world data to empower those living paycheck-to-paycheck to\n        build wealth\n      </p>\n      <hr />\n    </div>\n    <p>\n      For the culminating project of my Human Centered Design and Engineering\n      degree, my capstone team designed a financial literacy learning platform\n      for Chime, a financial technology company that offers both debit and\n      credit cards for users while getting rid of fees and allowing users to get\n      paid early. During our initial stakeholder meeting with Chime, we learned\n      that their users know what they have but feel they can’t build wealth. So,\n      we decided to focus our solution on users living paycheck to paycheck,\n      which we defined as those who make under $75,000 a year. Over the course\n      of twenty weeks, our project team planned, researched, and designed a\n      financial literacy application that draws upon users own finances as a baseline \n      for their learning experience. The final application was awarded an honorable\n      mention in the DEI category during the final capstone showcase.\n      <br />\n      <p>\n      To motivate our design process, we used began by developing the following research \n      and design questions:\n      <br /><br />\n      <b>Research Questions:</b>\n      \n      <ul>\n        <li>What categories of financial literacy are most useful to users?</li>\n        <li>What does financial literacy mean to users?</li>\n        <li>What is the easiest way for someone to build wealth?</li>\n        <li>How do you move from paycheck to paycheck to accumulate wealth?</li>\n        <li>What are the differences in the knowledge base between those who have \n          financial literacy and those who do not?</li>\n        <li>Why are users feel motivated to learn about finances?</li>\n        <li>What are the most effective ways to engage users on financial literacy?</li>\n        <li>How do people avoid and escape debt? </li>\n      </ul>\n      <b>Design Questions: </b>\n      <ul>\n        <li>How can we make financial literacy education more quick, fun, and accessible \n          and help build individuals’ wealth? </li>\n        <li>Do we design financial literacy education within users’ finance tools or \n          outside of it? </li>\n      </ul>\n    </p>\n\n    <h2>User Research</h2> \n    <p>To gain an understanding of our users, we conducted several rounds of user \n      research to understand the problem space we were working with, and to get a \n      more comprehensive understanding of the users we would be targeting. This user \n       research consisted of: secondary research, a survey, interviews, as well as the \n       creation of personas and user journey maps.\n      </p>\n    <h3>Secondary Research </h3>\n    <p>To begin our research project, we conducted two forms of secondary research. \n      First, we conducted a Chime App Audit with the goal of understanding what people \n      think of our sponsor company Chime.

But, after a meeting with \n      Chime, we decided to use Mark, a young professional, as our primary persona for this project; shifting Laura into our secondary persona. \n      Through Mark's persona, we decided to focus a large portion our design motivation around the goal of understanding and paying off student \n      debt. During our research, we noticed that a lot of the issues between our older and younger users were fairly similar. We realized that we \n      wanted to focus our design in intervening earlier so that the newer users don't fall into the same trap that our older users did in their \n      youth.  </p>\n    \n    <div  class=\"d-flex flex-lg-row flex-column justify-content-between\">\n      <div class=\"horiz\">\n        <img src=\"assets/fin-lit/mark.png\" alt=\"Mark Persona\"/>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"horiz\">\n    <img src=\"assets/fin-lit/laura.png\" alt=\"Laura Persona\"/>\n      </div></div>\n    <h3>User Journey Maps</h3>\n    <p>After creating personas, we made two user journey maps to highlight the experiences that our users have with financial literacy. \n      Laura's journey has a focus on providing for her family, gaining skills to make money, protecting her finances from overdraft fees, \n      and getting advice from her bank about her finances. Mark's journey map has a huge focus on social media financial literacy, \n      advice from parents, and stress about money along with a lack of understanding of how credit and debit work.  </p>\n    <div  class=\"d-flex flex-lg-row flex-column justify-content-between\">\n      <div class=\"horiz\">\n    <img src=\"assets/fin-lit/mark_jm.png\" alt=\"Mark Map\"/>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"horiz\">\n    <img src=\"assets/fin-lit/laura_jm.png\" alt=\"Laura Map\"/>\n    </div>\n    </div>\n    <h2>Ideation</h2> \n    <p> After our user research, we began to create problem statements and design goals to center our ideation. \n    <br /><br />\n    <b> Problem Statements</b>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Users often feel overwhelmed, lost, or intimidated knowing how to start learning about finances</li>\n      <li>Users lack the motivation to practice financial literacy</li>\n      <li>Financial practices like 401k or savings are abstract and can be difficult for users to visualize the benefits </li>\n      <li>Users are given advice that is not impactful to their current experience and suffers from \"shouldism\" for example \"I should be \n        investing\" or \"I should be in crypto\"</li>\n    </ul>\n    <b>Design Goals</b>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Balance giving the user impactful knowledge but also allowing them to explore various financial interests. We call this Free-range \n        design vs. Paternal design.</li>\n<li>Leave users feeling confident in their financial knowledge and the progress they are making in their learning</li>\n<li>Provide valuable information to help them here and now</li>\n<li>Clearly present information that is valuable to them using visual representations</li>\n<li>Create a trusting and non-judgemental learning environment</li>\n</ul>\n      After coming together to create these design goals, it was time to start generating ideas about what tools might be helpful in the \n      creation of a financial literacy application. To address this, we went through several design activities to scope out our solution \n      space this involved: crazy 8's, storyboarding, and the creation of workflows.\n    <h3>Crazy 8's</h3>\n    <p>\n      To begin our ideation, we wanted to generate as many ideas a possible. In order to do this most effectively, we choose to do crazy 8s We each did crazy-8's on our own, and then posted our work in the team FigJam. We then divided up each crazy-8's document into individual screens and grouped the screens based on functionality to decide where the team had the most overlap in their ideation. We came up with a variety of categories: onboarding, progress dashboard, learning simulation, lesson layout, testing content, resource locators, resource helpers, and financial calculators. With this overview of ideas, we then entered the storyboarding phase in which we took these ideas and thought about what those might look like for our users. \n\n    </p>\n    <img src=\"assets/fin-lit/crazy8.png\" alt=\"crazy 8s\" />\n    <h3>Storyboards</h3>\n    <p>Following our crazy 8's and a review of user research from previous weeks, we created storyboards to explore how potential problem-solving ideas would be accessed by our personas. </p>\n    <img src=\"assets/fin-lit/storyboards.png\" alt=\"storyboards\" />\n    <p><b>Results:</b> Storyboarding helped us identify how we can fit key features into an app format. It also helped us imagine when and where users would need these features. This gave us some direction in our Information Architecture helping us decide which ideated features to include, as well as in what order these features should appear in our applications hierarchy. </p>\n    <h3>User Workflows</h3> \n    <p>We began our wireframes with the design kit created by Chime. For this first iteration, we focused on onboarding processes, knowledge checks and lesson  plans. The workflow diagrams served as the blueprint for our wireframes. However, as we prototyped more and discussed as a group, we later changed certain aspects of our design. Critiquing the workflow diagrams as a group led us to refine ideas more and to decide which ideas were supported by our codebook and persona's needs. </p>\n     <img src=\"assets/fin-lit/workflow.png\" alt=\"storyboards\" />\n    <h2>Design and Iteration</h2>\n    <p>In the design of our final application, we went through three rounds of iteration, which are highlighted below. In this process, we were able to refine our scope, and focus on features that would be the most helpful for our users! </p>    \n    <h3>Iteration 1: Onboarding and Lessons</h3>\n    <p> We began our wireframes with the design kit created by Chime. For this first iteration, we focused on onboarding processes, knowledge checks and lesson  plans.\n    <img  class=\"screen\"  src=\"assets/fin-lit/phone_verify.jpg\" alt=\"phone verification\"/>\n    We choose to verify the user's identity via phone number. This serves two purposes: to make sure\n     that the user is real, and to allow the user to access their information and lesson plans from\n      various platforms and not just only from one device, which helps reduce the chance of losing \n      progress for the user and to ensure that the user would only have to enter their demographic \n      information one time. \n    <img class=\"screen\" src=\"assets/fin-lit/basic_info.jpg\" alt=\"demographic collection\"/>\nIn order to customize the experience, we begin by getting demographic information about the user. This will help us deliver a more customized experience, during our research people shared with us how they trust learning from people they can relate to. Our goal is to recommend lessons and activities which can be relatable to the user. We also want to make the race/ethnicity of the presenter match the user, once again to form that sense of trust. This is the first iteration, we will continue to explore individual interests and how that will impact their recommended learning. \n    <img  class=\"screen\" src=\"assets/fin-lit/fin_acct.png\"  alt=\"finances overview\" />\n    We know that some users are skeptical of linking banking accounts, especially to services that they do not know very well. To help give the most benefit for even our most skeptical users, we allowed for both financial account linkage to gain an understanding of our users finances, as well as a manual entry, which may feel safer to some. We may continue to iterate through the information which we are acquiring here to reduce any conflicts with user privacy. \n    <img  class=\"screen\" src=\"assets/fin-lit/lifestyle.jpg\" alt=\"lifestyle\"/>\n    To gain an understanding of the user's personal goals and the methods and lessons which might be needed in order to get them there, we decided to include a section in the onboarding to gather lifestyle/money habit details. Understanding lifestyle will help us make realistic recommendations for our users, in our research we found creating realistic goals is a motivator for people. The first section, goals, focuses on what the user wants to learn. In this process, they can select multiple topics for financial literacy which are of interest to them. This is where we apply our design goal of balance. We identify the user's goals but also include what will actually be beneficial for them. This information allows us to effectively tailor the lessons to be applicable to the current interests and would have real-world implications based on their financial situation. \n    <img  class=\"screen\" src=\"assets/fin-lit/checkpoint.jpg\" alt=\"quiz\" />\n    From our research we found users start with varying degrees of knowledge. We do not want to waste their valuable time so we determine their expertise upon completing an initial knowledge check. We intend for this quiz to contain a variety of questions across the wide range of topics offered within our curriculum. If the user wishes not to take this quiz, it is easy to skip.  \n    <img  class=\"screen\" src=\"assets/fin-lit/lesson.jpg\" alt=\"lessons\"/>\nFrom our user research, we found people need clarity, from the demographic and interest we developed a clear visual path for users to start learning finances. Each item on the learning map covers one topic that will cover their direct needs. In this example, when clicking through the personalized path you enter an overview of the sub-topics leading you to the first exercise. From our user research, we found people trust and seek out relatable people to learn from. Our plan is to share a story that may be relevant to that user. In this example Mark our persona would be watching a video from someone within his demographics. For accessibility, we include live transcripts. Following lessons, we include short quizzes this was inspired by learning apps like Duolingo and Zogo. The experience concludes with a celebration and a progress view of where they are on their personalized learning path.  \n    </p>\n    <h3>User Test 1</h3>\n    <p>\n      Financial literacy is a very personal topic, and we wanted to see user responses to the features that we had created. We wanted to understand if our service was gathering information that was too personal. \n<br /><br />\n<b>User group tested: </b> <br /> We interviewed users from our interviews and included others who were not interviewed but remained in the category of 75K. We chose this user group because we found they are our target user and their opinions would be most beneficial to our design\n<br /> <br /><b>Method: </b> <br /> Garnered feedback as we showed users a series of Figma screens all in a row, while we talked users through the onboarding process, the check your knowledge quiz, selecting a lesson from the customized lesson roadmap, and completing the comprehension quiz. We plan to gather quantitative data we do not believe at this step in the design process qualitative data will help up move forward.\n<br /><br />\n<b>Features tested: </b>\n<ul>\n  <li>Onboarding demographic, goal, and interests collection </li>\n  <li>Quizzes </li>\n  <li>Learning Activities</li>\n  <li>Progress Tracking</li>\n</ul>\n<b> Method of Evaluation: </b> <br />We implemented a code book to keep track of our qualitative data see example below\n    <br />  <br /><b>Findings: </b>\n      <ul>\n        <li>The fidelity of our prototype was too high and caused us to get feedback irrelevant to our goal of getting feedback on the features we created. The findings below are relevant to our user testing goal for our first iteration.\n          </li>\n<li>Users did not see value in an app that is primarily focused on quizzes and focusing on learning activities and which collected copious amounts of data, which seemed somewhat irrelevant, during the onboarding process. \n</li><li>Users wanted simplicity and clear guidance on how to make financial decisions first then the ability to learn about the why of the decision more if they so choose \n</li><li>Users want clear visuals of progress and current states \n</li><li>Users wanted to see a real copy and not lorem ipsum, without a real copy the concept was difficult to understand\n</li></ul></p>\n\n    <h3> Iteration 2: Goals, Lessons & Tracking</h3>\n    <p> After our user testing for or first iteration, we realized that our wireframes were too high in fidelity, and our design focus had been too focused on information collection and not on features that would provide value ot the user. So, we shifted gears to focus on goal setting and lessons. \n          <img class=\"screen\" src=\"assets/fin-lit/explore2.png\" alt=\"demographic collection\"/>\n<b>Explore: </b>\n<ul>\n  <li>Give users financial education related to their current financial situation and needs\n</li><li>Search within lessons for specific lessons\n</li><li>Inspired by users feeling most comfortable with googling financial advice and exploring on their own. \n</li><li>Includes lessons based on users financial needs\n</li></ul>\n          <img class=\"screen\" src=\"assets/fin-lit/budget2.png\" alt=\"demographic collection\"/>\n<b>Goal Setting feature:</b>\n<ul>\n  <li> Visually set goals and track progress \n</li><li>Recommend realistic goals for user\n</li><li>Allow users to visualize how various $ amounts affect their lives \n</li><li>Suggest content to follow up with once completing a goal \n</li><li>There were many iterations of this feature  \n</li></ul>\n<img class=\"screen\" src=\"assets/fin-lit/lesson2.png\" alt=\"demographic collection\"/>\n<b>Homepage </b>\n<ul>\n  <li>Quickly see the current state at a glance\n</li><li>Give users education within their finances\n  </li></ul>\n    <h3>User Test 2</h3>\n    <p>\n      After our design iteration in which we changed the flows which we created, and we wanted to see if the information to value ratio turned out better on this round. \n   <br /> <b>Goals:</b>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Does our idea make sense?</li>\n      <li>Does the flow provide them the needed information to get to the end of their task?</li>\n      <li>Learn what they would change and what they like about the flows and why?</li>\n    </ul>\n    <b>User Test Details</b>\n    <ul>\n      <li>4 User Testing Co-design Sessions</li>\n      <li>All testers made under 75K due to their alignment with our primary user group</li>\n      </ul>\n      <b>Method:</b> We presented users with the scenario of our main user persona who is trying to figure out financial aid after his aid has been revoked. Showed users multiple Figma pages in a row about four flows each with an individual task. \n      <br />\n      <ul>\n        <li><b>Task 1:</b> From your account, learn information about student loans and how you can change your habits to pay off your loans.\n        </li>\n        <li><b>Task 2:</b>Look through available lessons to find a lesson about passive income\n</li><li><b>Task 3: </b>From the money management dashboard, enter the information to track your student debt repayment. \n</li><li><b>Task 4:</b> Goal learning: From the dashboard, see how you would approach accomplishing paying off student debt. \nMethod of Evaluation: We implemented a code book to keep track of our qualitative data see example below.\n</li>\n      </ul>\n      <b>\nFindings: </b>\n<ul>\n  <li>Personalization was a good idea, however the examples needed to be even more personalized , such as providing real numbers instead of # signs\n  </li><li>Users didn’t know where to start due to lack of visual hierarchy and overwhelming amount of information from the lessons \n</li><li>Showing progress towards goals, and using goals as a motivator were helpful in keeping users engaged and motivated\n</li><li>Simplification was recommended among Budgeting Management Overview screens\n</li><li>Users were confused by lack of cohesion between the pages in these flows, and wanted to see navigation and overviews of the features that were actually available \n    </li></ul>  </p>\n    <h3> Iteration 3: Goals, Lessons & Tracking</h3>  \n    <p>After user testing, our next iteration had a huge focus on adding cohesion between the screens with the hopes of reducing previous confusion felt by the users.\n    <img class=\"screen\" src=\"assets/fin-lit/home3.png\" alt=\"demographic collection\"/>\n<b>Home Page</b>\n<ul><li>This iteration adds a navigation bar to connect home, explore lessons and settings.\n</li><li>Account and Goals are tabs on the homepage. On Accounts, users different banking accounts that show their total cash in each account.\n</li><li>On goals, users can see visuals of their projected goal, and can use sliders with personalized recommendations to customize their goal setting. Users can add funds towards their payoff goal and can track payments or “funds added” towards the goal. \n</li></ul>\n <img class=\"screen\" src=\"assets/fin-lit/set_goal3.png\" alt=\"demographic collection\"/>\n\n <b>Set Goal</b>\n    <ul>\n<li>Goal setting is connected tab to the homepage and allows users to add goals for savings, spending, debt, and custom goals</li>\n<li>Connected goals to accounts through linked account, credit card, or manual entry to allow for lots of personalization and choice </li>\n<li>Once a goal has been added, users can see visuals of their projected goal, and can use sliders with personalized recommendations to customize their goal setting.</li>\n    </ul>\n <img class=\"screen\" src=\"assets/fin-lit/pay_rough3.png\" alt=\"demographic collection\"/>\n<b>Make Payment </b>\n<ul>\n  <li>Once a goal has been added, users can see visuals of their projected goal, and can use sliders with personalized recommendations to customize their goal setting. </li>\n<li>Once a payment has been placed, the user is directed back to the goal overview page</li>\n</ul>\n \n <img class=\"screen\" src=\"assets/fin-lit/learn_rough3.png\" alt=\"demographic collection\"/>\n<b>Explore</b> \n<ul>\n  <li>Lessons were a separate page for users to learn financial topics of interest</li>\n<li>There are 2 tabs, all lessons and completed lessons so users can see what lessons they have already completed</li>\n<li>Users can search through the different lessons</li>\n<li>Lessons are recommended to users based on their goals and finances</li>\n<li>Users can resume lessons, review completed lessons, or start new lessons</li>\n<li>Within a lesson are submodules and a hands on learning activity linked to a user’s personal finances</li>\n<li>Users can hover over bolded terms to see definitions in paragraph text</li>\n<li>When users finish a lesson, they are shown a suggested lesson as a next step</li>\n</ul>\n    <h3>Chime Feedback & Critique</h3>\n    <p>\n      We decided to hold a critique session with Chime after previous positive experiences with the product that comes out of their feedback from our user tests.  Our goal for this was to get feedback about our design from our mentors at Chime who have a better understanding of designing for the context of those who are living paycheck to paycheck. We walked through our second iteration of low fidelity wireframes during our mentor feedback meeting, asking them for feedback about the design, and advice for better ways to motivate.\n  <br /> <br /><b>The features we went over were:</b>\n<ul>\n  <li>Navigation</li>\n<li>Home paged </li>\n<li>Goal setting </li>\n<li>  Explore lessons</li>\n</ul>\n\n<b>Findings: </b>\n<ul>\n<li>Simplification was key. Avoid showing users information excess information, but rather show them short and simple snippets of information\n</li><li>Make screens more actionable to help make learning and goal setting easier and more engaging and add contextualization of information in these interactions \n</li><li>Visual hierarchy and showing more visuals under goals\n  </li><li>\nRenaming certain features to make more sense and add empowerment to users, such as renaming </li>\n<li>Use of social proof to show users where they fall within the realm of finances when compared to their peers\n</li></ul> </p>\n    <h2>Final Prototype & Testing </h2>\n    <p>\n      In our final design and user testing, we focused on 3 main flows: the flow through lessons, the flow through setting a goal, and the flow for making a payment towards a goal. \n      <br /><b> Explore Lessons </b>\n      <img src=\"assets/fin-lit/final_lesson.png\" alt=\"\"/>\n      <b>What Worked Well:</b>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Applying one's learning to real life applications\n        </li><li>Toggle button for Learn & Review\n</li><li>Confetti upon completion\n</li><li>Visuals within submodules such as interactive graphs and charts\n</li></ul>\n<b>What Can Improve:</b>\n<ul>\n    <li>Adding more \"pizzaz\" to Skill Builder Overview\n</li><li>Adding more blurbs about the sub modules \n</li><li>Visual hierarchy of information and more consistency\n</li><li>Pagination to indicate scrolling within a submodule\n</li><li>Making definitions more clear as testers didn't click on bolded words\n  </li></ul>\n\n  <br />\n  <b>Long Term Goal Setting </b>\n      <img src=\"assets/fin-lit/final_goal_cat.png\" alt=\"\"/>\n<b>What Worked Well:</b>\n<ul>\n<li>Simple process with \"Add Goal +\" button\n</li><li>\"Enter Debt Manually\" was great for transparency and trust\n</li><li>Filtering by goal type\n</li></ul>\n\n<b>What Can Improve: </b> \n<ul><li>We actually did not have a way to pay goals within 10 years\n</li><li>Incorporating time frames to pay off debt related goals\n</li><li>Changing look of the dropdown as testers thought it was a checkmark\n  </li></ul>\n  <br />\n    <b>Long Term Goal Payment </b>\n      <img src=\"assets/fin-lit/pay_goal_final.png\" alt=\"\"/>\n     <b>What Worked Well:</b> \n     <ul><li>Interactive \"Monthly Repayment\" slider\n</li><li>\"What do these numbers mean?\" was great for transparency and trust\n</li><li>Confirmation banner with confetti\n</li></ul>\n<b>What Can Improve:</b> \n<ul>\n  <li>Calendaring and repayment dates can be more intuitive</li>\n  <li>Changing language used to be more direct and assertive</li>\n  <li>\"Estimated Total\" can become \"Total Loan Cost\" for more certainty</li>\n  <li>More transparency regarding payment and where it goes </li>\n<li>Formatting and conventions for banking numbers and dates</li>\n</ul>      \n\nOverall, this user testing session garnered at 4/5 in overall usability from 4 user testing sessions.\n \n  </p>\n  <h2>Next Steps</h2>\n  <p>\n    We came really far in our design ideas over the course of our project, and went through a lot of changes and transitions along the way. One of the biggest areas for growth  that we came across in our end product was the quality and depth of the lessons. We think that in order to better develop these lessons and ideas, an important next step would be to focus on UX writing and content strategy to more effectively present the financial literacy content to our users. Although the content we present is helpful, it may not be portrayed in the cleanest way, and there is definitely room for improvement. \n\nWe also ended our final design journey with a user testing session. Although we got decent reviews from our users, there was still a large amount of feedback which would help us improve our application. I am most excited about the inclusion of how much money has been put towards your goal at the top of the goal details page to show how much progress has been made towards the goal to motivate the user to make more  progress towards their goals. There was also a lot of improvements to be made to the lessons within our application. Although the content was solid, the layout could definitely use more reworking. We would add more color and engagement factors within the application, and would work to make the screens full of less text.   \n\nIf we were continue down this project, we would also want to create more screens and flows for our users learning experience such as the prototyping out the savings flow, budgeting flow, custom goal flow, and more content for the lessons that are available in the skill builder section. We then, obviously would perform more user testing and iterations upon our product with users who are working paycheck to paycheck.  \n    </p>\n    <h2>Reflection</h2>\n    <p>\n      This capstone project was a great experience. I was really worried at the start of this project to be designing for financial literacy when I really did not know very much about financial literacy myself. During our interview process, our intended user groups had just about as much financial literacy awareness as we did. One of the biggest barriers, especially among the college students was the lack of stable income as a student. In our interviews with the older generation of users had a lot of insights about what happens when you neglect financial literacy, and it also gave me insight into the pains associated with debt, especially for those in lower incomes. It was in our interview with the financial professor at UW that we were able to start to learn financial literacy, which was a key facet to having successful designs. I personally talked to my dad about financial literacy for the first time during this project. He seemed really excited that  I was interest in learning financial literacy and I'm grateful that this project allowed me to increase my financial literacy skills. It also motivated me to continue my own financial literacy journey after this project is complete.\n    </p>\n  </PortfolioPiece>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nimport PortfolioPiece from \"@/components/layouts/PortfolioPiece.vue\";\n\nexport default {\n  components: {\n    PortfolioPiece,\n  },\n};\n</script>\n<style scoped style=\"scss\">\n.chart {\n  padding: 0;\n}\n\n.horiz {\n  display: flex;\n  flex-flow: column;\n  width: 49%;\n}\n@media screen and (max-width: 992px) {\n  .horiz {\n    display: flex;\n    flex-flow: column;\n    width: 100%;\n    padding-bottom: 10px;\n   \n  }\n}\n\n.c {\n  text-align: center;\n  font-weight: bold;\n  margin-bottom: 5px;\n}\n\n.screen {\n  display: block;\n  width: 80%;\n  margin: auto;\n}\n</style>"],"sourceRoot":"src/views/portfolio"}]}
