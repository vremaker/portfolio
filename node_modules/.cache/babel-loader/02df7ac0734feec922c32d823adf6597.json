As a team of 4, we applied the\n        user centered design process to the problem area of the danger of\n        walking alone at night for students. The process culminated in a mobile\n        application called Night Owl that gives students confidence and control\n        when walking alone at night.\n      </p>\n\n      <h2>PROBLEM STATEMENT</h2>\n      <p>\n        University District is known to be a sketchy neighborhood. For example,\n        the Safeway northwest of campus is fondly called “Sketchway” by\n        students. This brings up the concern that walking near campus at night\n        can be dangerous for students; students should not have to be concerned\n        with their safety when walking around their university. This problem\n        resonates with our team and peers, which is why we wanted to tackle the\n        area of how to help students feel safe and confident walking near UW’s\n        campus during night.”\n      </p>\n\n      <h2>INTERVIEWS</h2>\n      <p>\n        Our research consisted of three different methods: semi-structured\n        interview, “fly on the wall” observation, and competitive analysis.\n        Through these methods, we learned more about our user group and their\n        goals and pain points as well as other products already on the market.\n        Each team member conducted a one-on-one interview with a student at the\n        University of Washington that walks during dusk or at night at least 4\n        times a month. We then regrouped and synthesized our findings into key\n        takeaways that would help us define our problem space and user group.\n      </p>\n\n      <h3>Key Takeaways:</h3>\n      <ul>\n        <li>\n          They felt more comfortable talking with a friend on the phone when\n          walking alone\n        </li>\n        <li>Walking home alone is unavoidable</li>\n        <li>They know about UW safety, but doesn’t know how it works</li>\n        <li>They are very aware of their surroundings</li>\n      </ul>\n      <h3>Individual Interviews:</h3>\n      <ul>\n        <li>\n          <a\n            href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VaVEy4UpKD1jpLRqlOqRArkhunDgciJn/view\"\n            target=\"_blank\"\n            >Maya's Interviews</a\n          >\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <a\n            href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CZLo_7Qzbt-jNqwxZFSeKI0GEpFxEXrz/view\"\n            target=\"_blank\"\n            >Valerie's Interviews</a\n          >\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <a\n            href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fU0MwbjINa_bEsWx1NxDP3ozXNGpl8Gb/view\"\n            target=\"_blank\"\n            >Peter's Interviews</a\n          >\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <a\n            href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oPi_3ShrLl2moqErynGaPI06bK3blrU5/view\"\n            target=\"_blank\"\n            >Lia's Interviews</a\n          >\n        </li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <h2>OBSERVATIONS</h2>\n      <p>\n        Next, as a team we performed a “fly on the wall” observation on the Ave.\n        The goal of this study was to observe and investigate the actions and\n        behaviors of students walking in the U District at night.\n      </p>\n      <img\n        src=\"assets/night-owl/street.png\"\n        alt=\"the corner of 45th and University Ave in Seattle's University District\"\n      />\n      <h3>Key Findings:</h3>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Users were interacting with their phone in some way</li>\n        <li>Users walking alone didn’t seem scared</li>\n        <li>Many users wore earbuds</li>\n      </ul>\n      <a\n        href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bnC4-I8SMbEtcSESTvVFnjK3JHV3tf9V/view\"\n        target=\"_blank\"\n        >Find the full observation document here</a\n      >\n      <h2>COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</h2>\n      <p>\n        Each team member conducted one competitive analysis on an existing\n        safety app. This allowed us to understand how existing products on the\n        market meet users’ needs and how they could be improved. We analyzed the\n        apps BSafe, Circle of 6, Sekura, and Noonlight. Overall, the apps all\n        had streamlined designs that generally made users feel safe, but also\n        had shortcomings such as confusing features and allowing users to easily\n        trigger emergency services on accident. We used this information to seek\n        opportunities, inspire our designs, and learn what to avoid.\n      </p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>\n          <a\n            href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sDMEpPfBFo0-krbwmo9DoYzp0f8WAvhV/view\"\n            target=\"_blank\"\n            >Sekura</a\n          >\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <a\n            href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tvpkDkMTISZ-MNfCNf2zx9QFNRNRkt-U/view\"\n            target=\"_blank\"\n            >Circle of 6</a\n          >\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <a\n            href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DqlQuCGTVTGIyUZcVeH58XN7XZwvyxlB/view\"\n            target=\"_blank\"\n            >Noonlight</a\n          >\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <a\n            href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aQa9VEE2RjTCpqlPM8jPYKB7LMkwHcLN/view\"\n            target=\"_blank\"\n            >BSafe</a\n          >\n        </li>\n      </ul>\n      <h2>USER PERSONAS</h2>\n      <p>\n        From our interviews, we gathered key insights on our users that we\n        compiled into categories such pain points, desires, and goals. These\n        helped us create personas grounded in data in order to avoid stereotypes\n        and assumptions. We chose to create two personas: one that was more\n        experienced with the U-District area and one that was only semi-familiar\n        with the area. This let us understand different user perspectives. Our\n        personas were a home base that we frequently visited to realign our\n        product and goals to our users’ needs.\n      </p>\n      <img src=\"assets/night-owl/amanda.png\" alt=\"Amanda Persona\" />\n      <img src=\"assets/night-owl/mallory.png\" alt=\"Mallory Persona\" />\n      <a\n        href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ezL8OijzPyig5U1rsJ2Ad_570KwMN8wk/view\"\n        target=\"_blank\"\n        >Find the full persona document here</a\n      >\n      <h2>USER JOURNEY MAPS</h2>\n      <p>\n        Our user journey maps represent the experiences of Amanda and Mallory,\n        two of our users, while walking home at night. We captured key touch\n        points between her and her environment and emotions throughout her walk\n        home. We focused on anxiety, alertness, and confidence as the emotions\n        we wanted to track, because they were the most prevalent emotions of our\n        interviewees. This journey map helped us understand our user’s feelings\n        and interactions while walking home.\n      </p>\n      <img src=\"assets/night-owl/amanda-map.jpeg\" alt=\"amanda map\" />\n      <img src=\"assets/night-owl/mallory-map.jpeg\" alt=\"mallory map\" />\n\n      <h2>DESIGN REQUIREMENTS</h2>\n      <p>\n        After better understanding our users and problem space through research,\n        we defined design requirements that outlined the functions of our\n        application. These requirements ensured that our solution solved user\n        pain points and satisfied their goals. In addition, they helped us\n        decide to focus on creating a phone app as our final product because it\n        would be able to fulfill the requirements. This would also be convenient\n        for our users since we observed that many of them interacted with their\n        phone in some way while walking at night.\n      </p>\n      <img src=\"assets/night-owl/aoc.png\" alt=\"action object context\" />\n      <img src=\"assets/night-owl/dfc.png\" alt=\"data function contextual\" />\n      <a\n        href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ahZiK5IC7KIrzcDx4orITnnQlw1ixcCK/view\"\n        target=\"_blank\"\n        >Find the full design requirements document here</a\n      >\n\n      <h2>STORYBOARDS</h2>\n      <p>\n        Each team member created two storyboards: one sketched and one photo or\n        photo hybrid. Each storyboard showed a specific scenario of our user\n        interacting with our potential product. It helped us visualize how our\n        user would interact with our potential solution. We chose to have each\n        team member focus on different user scenarios in order for us to\n        understand the full picture of the interactions between the user and our\n        product from the start to end of their walk.\n      </p>\n      <iframe\n        src=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vT7ZRiJRZz594YqNqFUgtkYilx3Y_mjmv6bztgaAo1AIPne7GY04ilbbpe-tWDHplDHZukXStqlQkTu/embed?start=true&loop=false&delayms=60000\"\n        frameborder=\"0\"\n        width=\"100%\"\n        height=\"569\"\n        allowfullscreen=\"true\"\n        mozallowfullscreen=\"true\"\n        webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"\n      ></iframe>\n\n      <h2>INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE</h2>\n      <p>\n        After deciding to make an app as our product, we started brainstorming\n        key features that would be the most helpful to our users. We utilized\n        our design requirements and user personas when ideating the app’s\n        features and how users would go through a specific task. Overall, our\n        information architecture showed the relationships and flows between each\n        feature. This set us up for success as we started ideating and creating\n        paper prototypes of our app screens.\n      </p>\n      <img src=\"assets/night-owl/ia.png\" alt=\"information architecture\" />\n      <h2>PAPER PROTOTYPING USABILITY TESTING</h2>\n      <p>\n        The paper prototypes were a quick, easy way to test our designed\n        features without distracting users with colors and photos. They helped\n        us pinpoint confusing and unintuitive aspects of our initial features,\n        which we incorporated into our redesign. First, we each individually\n        sketched and described three interfaces. Then, we came back together and\n        combined our rough draft sketches into consistent interface sketches for\n        our usability tests. Based on our storyboards and information\n        architecture diagram, we defined three key tasks that we asked users to\n        complete in our tests.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <em>Task 1:</em>User searches for a final destination, which will be\n        home. Then they will select the path that they want to take and start\n        their route.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <em>Task 2:</em>User reports a burglary incident and inputs the correct\n        information (date, time, description) and submits it. After submitting,\n        check that it was successfully added to the map.\n      </p>\n      <p><em>Task 3:</em>User adds new safety contact and then calls them.</p>\n      <h3>Participants:</h3>\n      <p>\n        We tested our prototype with four female University of Washington\n        students who walk alone at night at least once a week.\n      </p>\n      <h3>Method:</h3>\n      <p>\n        For each evaluation, we followed three major phases of testing in order\n        to cohesively gather quality information about our users and our app.\n        The first phase started off with an interview with each participant in\n        order to gather basic demographic information. The second phase\n        consisted of the main usability testing by providing users with a task\n        that they had to accomplish while observers recorded notes. During the\n        test, we asked participants to think out loud so that we could better\n        understand their thought process and pain points. To make it seem like a\n        real application, we used a Marvel App to conduct our usability testing.\n        Lastly, we performed a post test interview to get final details of what\n        participants thought of their experience of our solution to night\n        safety. After individually completing our usability tests, we came back\n        together to synthesize and analyze our findings. We found commonalities\n        in the features users struggled with, strengths and weaknesses of our\n        design, and suggestions for redesign.\n      </p>\n      <h3>Key Findings</h3>\n      <ul>\n        <li>\n          Users wanted to be able to share their location even when they hadn’t\n          started a path.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          Users did not expect the app to immediately call a contact after\n          clicking on their contact tile.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          Users want to be able to quickly input information when reporting a\n          hazard.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          Users stated that hazards have different urgency levels, which should\n          be reflected in the app.\n        </li>\n      </ul>\n      <div class=\"d-flex flex-column\">\n        <a\n          href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qPIgWAavYumI0R3QtWMOUUZ1rtpOxKA_/view\"\n          >Find the full usability test document here</a\n        >\n        <a\n          href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wC734_OE-8ysEgzNrrHeQwgDfsHXpCfU/view\"\n          >Find the full interface sketches document here</a\n        >\n      </div>\n      <h2>REFINEMENTS</h2>\n      <p>\n        Based on our findings from our usability tests we made some changes to\n        our designs. Below are the three main changes that we made based on user\n        feedback.\n      </p>\n      <h3>Report a Hazard:</h3>\n      <img src=\"/assets/night-owl/report.png\" alt=\"report a hazard\" />\n      <p>\n        Having different icon categories and hazard types was confusing, but\n        users still wanted hazards to be differentiated in some way. We made a\n        few changes based on this feedback:\n      </p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>\n          Removed different icon types and only allowed users to report hazards\n        </li>\n        <li>Removed hazard types</li>\n        <li>Allowed users to enter a title for the hazard</li>\n        <li>Added hazard levels (low, medium, and high danger)</li>\n      </ul>\n      <h3>Calling Safety Contact:</h3>\n      <img src=\"assets/night-owl/call.png\" alt=\"calling a safety contact\" />\n      <p>\n        When users tapped on a contact, they expected to be taken to an editing\n        page instead of it calling them, so we:\n      </p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>\n          Added a “call” button so that users would know that tapping it would\n          immediately call the contact\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          Tapping on the contact’s picture would bring them to the editing page\n        </li>\n      </ul>\n      <h3>Select a Route:</h3>\n      <img src=\"assets/night-owl/route.png\" alt=\"selecting a route\" />\n      <p>We made a few minor changes to this screen to alleviate confusion:</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Added “start route” button to collapsed menu</li>\n        <li>Moved “start route” button to the side</li>\n        <li>Added “From” text field at the top</li>\n      </ul>\n      <h2>ANNOTATED WIREFRAMES</h2>\n      <p>\n        Also based on our usability testing feedback, we redesigned and added\n        aspects to our wireframes. Then, looking back at our information\n        architecture, we created the app’s full functionality in Figma. These\n        wireframes were supposed to be low fidelity without color and real text\n        in order to strictly communicate the app’s features. We annotated each\n        screen to highlight key components and describe functionality. This step\n        helped us think about how our features worked together and was a useful\n        way to get feedback before designing our high fidelity prototypes.\n      </p>\n      <iframe\n        src=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRL2N2US5n7fW2v2BMZFqcVFdtpSxb_63q4bEmWDwWCgBMND7dLu54YJiiLi60cjkMb8bzZHOgr5VTT/embed?start=false&loop=false&delayms=60000\"\n        frameborder=\"0\"\n        width=\"100%\"\n        height=\"569\"\n        allowfullscreen=\"true\"\n        mozallowfullscreen=\"true\"\n        webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"\n      ></iframe>\n\n      <h2>HIGH FIDELITY PROTOTYPE</h2>\n      <p>\n        Based on all our research and testing, we created an app called Night\n        Owl, that students could use to feel safe when walking alone at night.\n        The app has two main components: safety circle and map.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        In the safety circle, based on interviewees stating they feel\n        comfortable when they’re walking and talking to their friend, users are\n        able to quickly and easily call their friends. If their friends are\n        busy, users can call the bot. The bot will record and talk to them,\n        mimicking a ‘friend’ listening to you in case your are in a dangerous\n        situation.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        On the map, users can select a destination and the safest path to get\n        there. Once the user starts their route, their safety contacts will be\n        alerted and the app will automatically send another notification when\n        the user gets to their final destination; this happens automatically\n        because it’s easy to forget to let your friends know you got home safe.\n        To keep the incidents up to date on the map, we use crowdsourcing; users\n        can report and confirm hazards.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        After user feedback, we made the SOS button be easily clickable, which\n        brings up a popup that counts down from 5 seconds and then calls 911. If\n        the user accidently pressed the SOS button, they can easily cancel it.\n        But we learned that it’s important the SOS button be very quick to use\n        in case of a dire situation.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        For our colors, we chose dark mode because users would be using this app\n        at night, so we wanted the screen to be subdued. Our color scheme is\n        dark blue, bright orange, and bright red. It is important to create high\n        contrast to show key information. Orange represents important actionable\n        items such as reporting a hazard and starting route. The bright red is\n        used only for the SOS button to ensure it stands out in case of\n        emergency.\n      </p>\n      <iframe\n        src=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRkHp-cF2YFbECqU7HqJx7N3RFlvbFBt5B0qjV56rOjoO5U2NFuqssJbG4mCIzL5zZhFWtvyG4Vd0LR/embed?start=false&loop=false&delayms=60000\"\n        frameborder=\"0\"\n        width=\"100%\"\n        height=\"569\"\n        allowfullscreen=\"true\"\n        mozallowfullscreen=\"true\"\n        webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"\n      ></iframe>\n      <h2>Video Demos of Night Owl:</h2>\n      <h3>Add a Contact</h3>\n      <iframe\n        width=\"100%\"\n        height=\"315\"\n        src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/EXme5E_8iGg\"\n        title=\"YouTube video player\"\n        frameborder=\"0\"\n        allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"\n        allowfullscreen\n      ></iframe>\n      <h3>Report A Hazard and Select a Route</h3>\n      <iframe\n        width=\"100%\"\n        height=\"315\"\n        src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FqrJq6qdI88\"\n        title=\"YouTube video player\"\n        frameborder=\"0\"\n        allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"\n        allowfullscreen\n      ></iframe>\n      <h3>Add New Location Favorite</h3>\n      <iframe\n        width=\"100%\"\n        height=\"315\"\n        src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ycDCc9rzfPo\"\n        title=\"YouTube video player\"\n        frameborder=\"0\"\n        allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"\n        allowfullscreen\n      ></iframe>\n\n      <h2>REFLECTION</h2>\n      <p>\n        Overall, this project was challenging and definitely stretched our\n        thinking in both design and teamwork. Working with a group to create a\n        high-fidelity mockup for a product in just 11 weeks was difficult and\n        required hard work from everyone. We learned that designing with a team\n        requires clear and effective communication, compromise, and a lot of\n        dedication. With that being said, we’re all proud of our final product\n        and enjoyed every step of the design process.\n      </p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>More user research and usability testing</li>\n        <li>\n          Explore optimizing map path finding for users going between the same\n          two places multiple times a week\n        </li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>\n        If we had more time, we definitely would have conducted more user\n        research and usability testing. Specifically, it would have been useful\n        to do competitive analysis on other technologies and services rather\n        than just apps. Also, although a phone app fit our design requirements,\n        we didn’t have much time to think about alternative forms of our final\n        product. We definitely would’ve wanted to explore other options,\n        especially since our user group of students walking at night should\n        actually be discouraged from using their phones.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        In addition, there were parts of our app that we want to test more\n        because we are unsure of their effectiveness or usefulness. One of these\n        functions is the SOS button; we had gotten a lot of feedback about how\n        to make it easily accessible while not making it easy to accidentally\n        trigger. Based on user feedback, we were able to incorporate a solution\n        into our final design, but we would want to test with more users.\n        However, it was difficult to actually test the true functionality of the\n        SOS button because it’s meant to be used in emergency situations.\n        Another feature that we were unsure about was the ability to call a Bot.\n        Some of our users said that they would feel weird talking to a Bot and\n        wouldn’t use it, while some said they would. With more time, we would’ve\n        wanted to figure out how to make this feature truly useful to our users.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        One really interesting question we received was about our research into\n        how often our users were going between the same two points every week,\n        and how we can optimize our map function to those users. This question\n        was very thought-provoking; since one of our features was pathfinding on\n        a map, we immediately turned to pre-existing solutions (e.g. Google\n        Maps, Apple Maps) as a base. However, these solutions are made to deal\n        with someone starting from anywhere and going to anywhere. Dealing with\n        the situation of users going between the same two points multiple times\n        a week might result in a completely different solution. If we had the\n        time, we would want to explore optimization for this specific situation.\n      </p>\n      <p>Finally, here are some key takeaways from each of us:</p>\n\n      <p></p>\n      <p>\n        <em>Maya:</em> At the end of the project, I was surprised by how much a\n        “final” design can still be improved. It was a little disheartening\n        seeing how much critique our (almost) final design received, but when I\n        thought about it, pretty much every design in the world can be improved\n        in some way.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <em>Valerie:</em> This has been one of the most incredible design\n        experiences I have had. I love working in groups to design artifacts\n        rather than trying to design something complex like Night Owl on your\n        own. I loved watching our project grow as we shared ideas and made\n        compromises about our designs. Each member of the team brought something\n        very unique to the table, and although it was challenging to incorporate\n        what worked best for all of us, it was in this diversity of the\n        designers in our group that we were able to produce a product that we\n        are all proud of.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <em>Peter:</em> Overall, this experience from start to finish has been\n        memorable. I enjoyed collaborating with my teammates as we each had\n        important contributions to Night Owl. As for the project itself, we may\n        have finished the first iteration of the high fidelity prototype, but\n        there is still much improvements we can make, especially after our final\n        critique.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <em>Lia:</em>I learned how to optimize time and create quality work by\n        understanding and using each team mate’s skills and passions. At\n        different steps in our process, each one of us went above and beyond to\n        help the project excel.\n      </p>\n      <img class=\"mb-5\" src=\"assets/night-owl/team.png\" alt=\"the night owl team\" />\n    </div>\n  </PortfolioPiece>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nimport PortfolioPiece from \"@/components/layouts/PortfolioPiece.vue\";\n\nexport default {\n  components: {\n    PortfolioPiece,\n  },\n};\n</script>\n<style scoped>\n.cow {\n  width: 100%;\n  display: flex;\n  justify-content: center;\n}\n.sm-img {\n  width: 30%;\n  padding-top: 5%;\n  padding-bottom: 2%;\n  margin: auto;\n}\n\nimg {\n  width: 100%;\n}\n\nem {\n  font-weight: 900;\n}\n\n#dci {\n  margin-bottom: 100px;\n}\n</style>"],"sourceRoot":"src/views/portfolio"}]}
