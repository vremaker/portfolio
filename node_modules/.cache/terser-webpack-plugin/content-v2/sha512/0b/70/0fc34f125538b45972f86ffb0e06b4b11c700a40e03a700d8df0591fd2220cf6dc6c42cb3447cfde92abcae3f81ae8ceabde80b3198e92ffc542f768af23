Our interviews with the older generation of users, had similar insights about what happens when you neglect financial literacy, and it also gave me insight into the pains associated with debt, especially for those in lower incomes. It was in our interview with the financial professor at UW that we were able to start to learn financial literacy, which was a key facet to having successful designs.

Having the VUI state the number of loops there should be proves effective then it would be able to be distributed without connection to an app. Future iterations of Crochet Buddy would also instructions for more stitches than the three stitches used for this prototype. I would also change the script to possibly include more crochet specific terms. When I was writing my scripts this time around I was trying to use words that maybe were more descriptive, but given my user testing and evaluation I believe having the more specific terms would be more effective, especially if there is a way for users to interact with Crochet Buddy to find out the definitions of the more niche crochet terms if they aren’t obvious enough. \")]),o(\"p\",[e._v(\" The next step for Crochet Buddy’s learning and educational systems would be the creating of a mobile application which would integrate a GUI into the pre-existing VUI and stitch tracking capabilities of Crochet Buddy.

Then, when her class did not begin on time, because her quiz section TA did not show up, the observation switched to watching her as she tried to figure out where to attend/watch class another way. During this observation, I sat on her bed and mostly stayed out of the way, asking an occasional clarification question. Although the flow for each observation was slightly different, the field notes were taken in a similar fashion. While observing I took jottings and short notes in a pink a4 notebook. Beside me, I had my stopwatch running, so that I could mark the time approximately every 5 minutes to understand the ebb and flow of these observations. Then, I translated the jottings into ethnographic field notes. \")]),o(\"p\",[e._v(\" Unlike the two unique field observations, the two interviews followed the same semi structured interview protocol. These interviews took place over Zoom and were recorded using their cloud recording feature. The interview consisted of questions based in four sections. It began with questions about college students including questions about what the student is studying, college year, number of credits, as well as their goals and motivations. Next, there were questions about synchronous classes including background information about the format of the online classes, the benefits and drawbacks, and stories from their virtual classroom experience. It then transitioned into more details about attending virtual classes including descriptions of what it looks like to attend virtual class for each student, signals and prompts that cause a student to engage or participate in class, and how the expert ace of class hand change with the switch to online classes. We concluded the interview by discussing how students focused in virtual class including recounting times when they have felt both focused and unfocused, changes in focus with the switch to online classes, what type of distractions they encounter, and what the biggest obstacles to focus have been. After each interview, I read through the transcripts and made them readable, so that they would be ready for analysis. \")]),o(\"p\",[e._v(\" Using a modified grounded theory approach, I began my data analysis. Using my research question “how do college students motivate and maintain productivity while learning from home?” as a guiding light, I read through my observational field notes from Kai and Gus as well as my interview transcripts from Travis and Victoria and began to make codes. I ended up with codes in three main categories, each with a set of subcodes. First there is the General details about participants and their space which consists of the codes: workstation detail, class detail, participants background, work versus relax areas. Second there is focus (or lack thereof) and meeting class goals, which consists of the codes: methods of focus, mental barrier to focus, accountability for getting work done, distraction from focus, feelings about being distracted. Finally, there is virtual classroom culture and how it differs from in person, which consists of the codes: participation, breakout room variation, technical difficulties, frustration, online teaching skill level, pre-recorded lecture habits, zoom camera etiquette and habits, class community building, exceptions made because of the pandemic, and class attendance changes. These codes were then used to create memos about general themes that were found in the data. These memos were turned into the findings included in the next section. \")]),o(\"h2\",[e._v(\"FINDINGS\")]),o(\"p\",[e._v(\" Through coding and analysis, four main themes were discovered: separation of spaces, decrease in accountability, widespread zoom burnout, and the varying degrees of virtual participation. \")]),o(\"h3\",[e._v(\"Separation of Spaces\")]),o(\"p\",[e._v(\" The biggest factor to consider when thinking about the space a pandemic student occupies is how they attempt to create a separation between their “working spaces,” where they are productive and get things done, and their “relaxation spaces,” where they can decompress and rest. Each student had distinct areas in which they relaxed or were productive, but these spaces were manifested in different ways. Gus, for example, has “two chairs: a chair for focused work and a more comfortable chair for gaming and relaxing. The chair that normally faces his monitors is a relaxation chair.” (Gus, 222–223) Gus also has his monitors set up so that “they could very easily be used as a TV with a good view from the bed.” (Gus, 260–261) Kai on the other hand had two tapestries that “seem to serve as a bit of a divider for her bedroom, as they cover all the wall above where the bed touches the wall.” (Kai 217- 219) She also has a galaxy light simulator that sits on her dresser. She likes to turn it on when she is relaxing in bed. (Kai 231–2) Victoria has designated her bed as her relaxation space. Usually, when she is in classes, she tries to stay engaged in a chair with her camera on, but when she is feeling super tired and does not want to participate, she will sit in her bed with her camera off. (Victoria 133–135) Thus, students transformed a place that used to be mainly for relaxation into a space where they spend almost all their time due to the shelter in place orders set by the coronavirus pandemic. \")]),o(\"h3\",[e._v(\"Decrease in Accountability\")]),o(\"p\",[e._v(\" Students note that although they had distractions during in person classes, the ways in which they are distracted has shifted dramatically with the move to online learning. One student, Travis, noted that he used to fall asleep a fair amount during in person classes (only for a few minutes at a time, sometimes multiple times a day), but since the move to online classes, he finds that he no longer sleeps because he is distracted by a lot more things such as homework for his other classes, Reddit and YouTube. (Travis 64) Travis noted that because he had three monitors, his intense distractions during class was camouflaged. Even when he was not paying very much attention to the class. He slyly claimed, “when I’m looking at other shit going on, [I’m] distracted, but it looks like I’m focusing at the same time. So that’s the beauty of it.” (Travis 160–162) This led Travis to take less notes during online classes. (Travis 168) It is very difficult to gauge productivity and focus when you are looking at a blank square with their name in it, or at a tiny video feed of just their face. The virtual world has fewer physical indicators of focus, and they are hard to see; this creates far less accountability towards actually paying attention in virtual class. Another student, Victoria, noted that in person, she used to not use her phone when she was in smaller classes because she is terrified of authority, but now, during virtual classes, she finds herself using her phone more even in the smaller classes because she “feels there’s way less consequences now.” She also noted that she’s on her phone during class because she wants to be doing anything but learning from home (Victoria 141–147) Although she is more likely to show up to all of her classes because attending class is as simple as clicking a button, she finds that she spends more time on her phone during class. \")]),o(\"h3\",[e._v(\"Zoom Burnout\")]),o(\"p\",[e._v(\" Each student has different ways of keeping up with their schoolwork and remaining productive while feeling the burnout involved in having entirely virtual classes. Gus gets his motivation from the creation of clean workspaces. When he looks at his desk he thinks, “that is a proper desk” and it motivates him to get work done. (Gus 187–189) Gus also uses a stimulant called nuvigil to help him focus, because he has ADHD (Gus 235). Kai keeps focused by using a pile of small scraps of paper, which she used to keep track of the work that she has due for all her classes. Each slip represents a different class, and she lists the assignments on the lines below.” (Kai 186–189) Despite keeping up with their assignments, student engagement in classes is way down, probably because all classes take place in essentially the same space, a student’s computer, rather than being located in different buildings all across campus as is the case when classes are in person. Not one, but two participants from this study struggled to fully remember their class schedule even though I talked with them during the fifth week of a ten-week quarter, a point where, had the classes been in person their schedules would have been fully memorized. Travis could not list all of the classes he was taking without looking at his canvas page. (Travis 32) Victoria had forgotten about a weekly class meeting because it had been cancelled for the past two weeks for various reasons including election stress and an exam. (Victoria 36–37) This is a clear sign of the burnout that students are facing as online synchronous classes continue to be the only way to attend class during this pandemic. This burnout also occasionally affected class attendance. Victoria, for example, would leave classes prematurely if she felt particularly burned out, due to being stressed out by other things, or if she was having a bad mental health day where she could not stand to be at her computer anymore (Victoria 71–75) If these classes were in person, there would be some motive (and a change of scenery), but in the modern era of virtual learning, it feels like I must sit through it and the phone is a ready distraction to help alleviate the pain and stress of being stuck at your computer for school all day every day (Victoria 149–151). \")]),o(\"h3\",[e._v(\"Decrease in Participation\")]),o(\"p\",[e._v(\" The consensus for the experiences in online classes is that they are not as interactive, because there are less opportunities to interact with other students. (Travis 62–3) The switch from on campus learning to holding classes entirely though video conferencing software has wrought havoc on class participation. Many students taking online classes never have their camera on, and some only turn it on for short periods of time. In most classes there are typically under five students with their camera on, no matter how large the class is. Yet, in some classes, the only person with their camera on is the professor. For Travis, “sometimes, no one turns their camera on or participates, it’s only me, but in their classes, more people turn the cameras, which is kind of nice.” (Travis 95) Travis stated that “I feel bad for the instructors sometimes when they are staring at a blank board. Sometimes it’s easier to interact and have a productive class session that mimics the tradition classroom experience by having my camera on” (Travis 100–103) For Victoria, in her “smaller classes, it’s me and like one or two other people who will turn on their camera, but most people are willing to participate.” (Victoria, 42–45) This highlights a strange new culture in the classroom, students who are too shy to participate with their video on or to use their voice but are willing to participate through the chat. Victoria finds that although in the main session most cameras are off, “in breakout rooms, most people do turn on their cameras, and I keep mine on. I participate a lot because no one else really does.” (Victoria, 88–91) As people become more accustomed to Zoom (and probably more desperate for social interactions), the culture around Zoom becomes more solidified in the concept that “if you are in a breakout room, you unmute yourself and turn on your camera. And I think that that’s like becoming a little bit more universal and that’s made it easier as well.” (Victoria 128–130) Both Travis and Victoria are motivated to have their camera on for similar reasons, to replicate the real Zoom experience. I find it strange that the two people that I interview seem to have their camera on a lot, yet most students still keep their cameras off for the majority of synchronous classes. Students seem to have two main motivators for participating and focusing during online classes. The first being the fact that it is “still paying full tuition for the classes for basically doing Khan Academy online. So, I might as well get the most of my learning experience.” (Travis, 133–135) The second being out of respect for the professors, because, again, students are paying to be there to learn from these professors. (Victoria 54) \")]),o(\"h2\",[e._v(\"DESIGN IMPLICATIONS\")]),o(\"p\",[e._v(\" More than anything, the findings of this study show how truly desolate the social arena looks for college students during the pandemic. Normally college life is typically filled with some of the most social interactions in a student’s developmental life. The decrease in social interactions, which impacts student focus, seems to hinge solely on the new limitations of the era: being stuck in your house due to the coronavirus pandemic, as well as the limitations of engagement that video conferencing services provide. These struggles highlight a key area for design improvement: how to make virtual interactions feel more real, and how to encourage student social interaction despite the barriers presented by online learning in the pandemic. This is a huge design opportunity for software industry professionals as they continue to create software and programs that will facilitate face to face interactions despite not being together in person. Some solutions such as Remo aim to mimic the in-person space by creating a bit of an RPG Pokémon-esque experience. This still utilizes video conferencing though which still limits the degree to which you can interact with other people and participants. Based on the truly astounding burnout that students are feeling towards Zoom, as well as the new standards of attending big lectures without your video on, the methods that are based solely on interaction over video camera seem to be a bit naïve. By understanding student focus participation and distraction, engineers can attempt to build classroom environments for better focusing for students. \")]),o(\"p\",[e._v(\" This research could also be used to inform the creation of curricula for future online classes, because it is very apparent that we probably will not be back together on campus until at least spring quarter 2021, but more realistically, students will not be back on campus until the fall of 2021. This research on what is distracting to students, and how students handle their focusing while learning from home, could be vital in making changes and accommodations to current class formats in order to be better suited for the online world. This could be through changing the class format from asynchronous to synchronous, changing the type of projects and assessments being given to students, and changing the way that students interact, or even by creating new methods and forums for class participation. \")]),o(\"h2\",[e._v(\"CONCLUSION\")]),o(\"p\",[e._v(\" The swift and disruptive changes that rocked the world at the start of the novel coronavirus Pandemic had caused intense drastic change in the way that college students attend class. Students moved from in person classes to virtual classes to taking either asynchronous classes or synchronous classes online from their home. Starved of the social and physical interactions of normal college life, student morale and mental health is very low, yet students are still chugging along towards their degree, which led the study to explore this question: how do college students motivate and maintain productivity while learning from home? This study found that focus and learning from home was drastically impacted by four factors: the way in which student separated the space in their home to have distinct areas for study and focus as well as relaxation and decompression, as well as the decrease in accountability that students feel during virtual classes, focusing during class while it is online, changes in what it means to participate in class, and the large effects of zoom burnout. These barriers to focus seem to hinge on the new limitations of the era: being stuck in your house due to the coronavirus pandemic, as well as the limitations of engagement that video conferencing services provide. \")]),o(\"p\",[e._v(\" The biggest limiting factor of this study is the small sample size. These limited results make the overarching results of this study less generalizable. This study may also have been slightly limited using Zoom as my main platform for interviewing, especially because the physical space seems to have a large impact on the productivity of a student while learning from home. Although I am content with my research question, in further iterations of this study, my interview protocol would contain more questions about the separation of space. Because way that space is divided seemed to have a very large impact on mental health, which is a huge factor in pandemic focus. I would also increase the number of participants and solidify the field observation protocol so that it is only while the student is getting work done for a particular class. \")]),o(\"h2\",[e._v(\"ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTS\")]),o(\"ul\",[o(\"li\",[o(\"a\",{attrs:{href:\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-OrVFr3Gy8ltkjtzftkSwbXR4_DasHBhTi-51Rt4-R0/edit#gid=0\",target:\"_blank\"}},[e._v(\"Codebook\")])]),o(\"li\",[o(\"a\",{attrs:{href:\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vYlTVYClcIQo1Goxh9k9lS0Lnpv08uow/view\",target:\"_blank\"}},[e._v(\"Travis Interview Transcript\")])]),o(\"li\",[o(\"a\",{attrs:{href:\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/19_3N_A1Be8cC-FvImviwk0V-F224OIYv/view\",target:\"_blank\"}},[e._v(\"Victoria Interview Transcript\")])]),o(\"li\",[o(\"a\",{attrs:{href:\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lTL56eAq9LaKlvXTP2EqiCoYPvAP9_kr/view\",target:\"_blank\"}},[e._v(\"Gus Observation Field Notes\")])]),o(\"li\",[o(\"a\",{attrs:{href:\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ot7GZp_TIWPVzKMnI1_mj2Xi12gfOZSI/view\",target:\"_blank\"}},[e._v(\"Kai Observation Field Notes\")])]),o(\"li\",[o(\"a\",{attrs:{href:\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uvzPlP1w6cx2eboPBsJWAdNznIDPaail/view\",target:\"_blank\"}},[e._v(\"The Final Report\")])])]),o(\"div\",{staticClass:\"d-flex flex-column flex-md-row text-center justify-content-between\"},[o(\"router-link\",{attrs:{to:\"/nature\"}},[o(\"b\",[e._v(\"Previous Project: \")]),e._v(\" Access to Nature and Crime\")])],1)])},i=[],s=o(\"a657\"),n={components:{PortfolioPiece:s[\"a\"]}},r=n,h=o(\"2877\"),l=Object(h[\"a\"])(r,a,i,!1,null,null,null);t[\"default\"]=l.exports},f820:function(e,t,o){\"use strict\";o.r(t);var a=function(){var e=this,t=e.$createElement,o=e._self._c||t;return o(\"WithNav\",[o(\"div\",{staticClass:\"cow d-flex justify-content-around align-items-center align-items-lg-center\\n      mt-5 mt-lg-0\"},[o(\"div\",{staticClass:\"\\n        d-flex\\n        justify-content-around\\n        align-items-center\\n        flex-column flex-lg-row\\n      \"},[o(\"div\",{staticClass:\"cow small d-flex justify-content-center align-items-center\",style:{\"background-image\":\"url(assets/vertical-swoop.png)\"},attrs:{id:\"img\"}},[o(\"img\",{staticClass:\"image rounded-circle\",attrs:{src:\"assets/val.jpeg\",alt:\"A blonde girl standing in front of a colorful wall\"}})]),o(\"img\",{staticClass:\"image rounded-circle mt-5\",attrs:{id:\"mobile\",src:\"assets/val.jpeg\",alt:\"A blonde girl standing in front of a colorful wall\"}}),o(\"div\",{staticClass:\"large\",attrs:{id:\"text-box\"}},[o(\"div\",{attrs:{id:\"text\"}},[o(\"h1\",{staticClass:\"pt-0\"},[e._v(\"It's nice to meet you!\")]),o(\"p\",[e._v(\" I'm Valerie Remaker and I graduated from The University of Washington pursuing a double degree in Human Centered Design and Engineering (HCDE) and Psychology.
