The light rails main flaw is that the tap on tap off system is kind of a pain to use and the range of the light rail is very limited, but it is being expanded.

Many students both asynchronous and synchronous classes in their schedule. The main difference between these two class formats is that synchronous classes have a set time where students and the professor got together in a video conference of some sort, typically Zoom, and have lecture and section live.

Each field observation had the same main goal of understanding how students set up their rooms, a space where they are now spending almost all their time due to the shift that made classes entirely virtual.

This included quiet observation of the room, as well asking him a couple of questions about specific items and oddities I noticed. During this observation, I sat on Gus’s desk chair which had been made from an old car seat, to get a basic understanding of his space. Kai, on the other hand had synchronous classes, which allowed me to sit in and observe her while she was in a quiz section. Kai’s observation began with a general overview of the space she was in, while Kai waited for class to start. Then, when her class did not begin on time, because her quiz section TA did not show up, the observation switched to watching her as she tried to figure out where to attend/watch class another way. During this observation, I sat on her bed and mostly stayed out of the way, asking an occasional clarification question. Although the flow for each observation was slightly different, the field notes were taken in a similar fashion. While observing I took jottings and short notes in a pink a4 notebook.

It then transitioned into more details about attending virtual classes including descriptions of what it looks like to attend virtual class for each student, signals and prompts that cause a student to engage or participate in class, and how the expert ace of class hand change with the switch to online classes. We concluded the interview by discussing how students focused in virtual class including recounting times when they have felt both focused and unfocused, changes in focus with the switch to online classes, what type of distractions they encounter, and what the biggest obstacles to focus have been.

Each student had distinct areas in which they relaxed or were productive, but these spaces were manifested in different ways. Gus, for example, has “two chairs: a chair for focused work and a more comfortable chair for gaming and relaxing. The chair that normally faces his monitors is a relaxation chair.” (Gus, 222–223) Gus also has his monitors set up so that “they could very easily be used as a TV with a good view from the bed.” (Gus, 260–261) Kai on the other hand had two tapestries that “seem to serve as a bit of a divider for her bedroom, as they cover all the wall above where the bed touches the wall.” (Kai 217- 219) She also has a galaxy light simulator that sits on her dresser. She likes to turn it on when she is relaxing in bed. (Kai 231–2) Victoria has designated her bed as her relaxation space. Usually, when she is in classes, she tries to stay engaged in a chair with her camera on, but when she is feeling super tired and does not want to participate, she will sit in her bed with her camera off. (Victoria 133–135) Thus, students transformed a place that used to be mainly for relaxation into a space where they spend almost all their time due to the shelter in place orders set by the coronavirus pandemic. \")]),a(\"h3\",[e._v(\"Decrease in Accountability\")]),a(\"p\",[e._v(\" Students note that although they had distractions during in person classes, the ways in which they are distracted has shifted dramatically with the move to online learning. One student, Travis, noted that he used to fall asleep a fair amount during in person classes (only for a few minutes at a time, sometimes multiple times a day), but since the move to online classes, he finds that he no longer sleeps because he is distracted by a lot more things such as homework for his other classes, Reddit and YouTube. (Travis 64) Travis noted that because he had three monitors, his intense distractions during class was camouflaged. Even when he was not paying very much attention to the class. He slyly claimed, “when I’m looking at other shit going on, [I’m] distracted, but it looks like I’m focusing at the same time. So that’s the beauty of it.” (Travis 160–162) This led Travis to take less notes during online classes. (Travis 168) It is very difficult to gauge productivity and focus when you are looking at a blank square with their name in it, or at a tiny video feed of just their face. The virtual world has fewer physical indicators of focus, and they are hard to see; this creates far less accountability towards actually paying attention in virtual class. Another student, Victoria, noted that in person, she used to not use her phone when she was in smaller classes because she is terrified of authority, but now, during virtual classes, she finds herself using her phone more even in the smaller classes because she “feels there’s way less consequences now.” She also noted that she’s on her phone during class because she wants to be doing anything but learning from home (Victoria 141–147) Although she is more likely to show up to all of her classes because attending class is as simple as clicking a button, she finds that she spends more time on her phone during class. \")]),a(\"h3\",[e._v(\"Zoom Burnout\")]),a(\"p\",[e._v(\" Each student has different ways of keeping up with their schoolwork and remaining productive while feeling the burnout involved in having entirely virtual classes. Gus gets his motivation from the creation of clean workspaces. When he looks at his desk he thinks, “that is a proper desk” and it motivates him to get work done. (Gus 187–189) Gus also uses a stimulant called nuvigil to help him focus, because he has ADHD (Gus 235). Kai keeps focused by using a pile of small scraps of paper, which she used to keep track of the work that she has due for all her classes. Each slip represents a different class, and she lists the assignments on the lines below.” (Kai 186–189) Despite keeping up with their assignments, student engagement in classes is way down, probably because all classes take place in essentially the same space, a student’s computer, rather than being located in different buildings all across campus as is the case when classes are in person. Not one, but two participants from this study struggled to fully remember their class schedule even though I talked with them during the fifth week of a ten-week quarter, a point where, had the classes been in person their schedules would have been fully memorized. Travis could not list all of the classes he was taking without looking at his canvas page. (Travis 32) Victoria had forgotten about a weekly class meeting because it had been cancelled for the past two weeks for various reasons including election stress and an exam. (Victoria 36–37) This is a clear sign of the burnout that students are facing as online synchronous classes continue to be the only way to attend class during this pandemic. This burnout also occasionally affected class attendance. Victoria, for example, would leave classes prematurely if she felt particularly burned out, due to being stressed out by other things, or if she was having a bad mental health day where she could not stand to be at her computer anymore (Victoria 71–75) If these classes were in person, there would be some motive (and a change of scenery), but in the modern era of virtual learning, it feels like I must sit through it and the phone is a ready distraction to help alleviate the pain and stress of being stuck at your computer for school all day every day (Victoria 149–151). \")]),a(\"h3\",[e._v(\"Decrease in Participation\")]),a(\"p\",[e._v(\" The consensus for the experiences in online classes is that they are not as interactive, because there are less opportunities to interact with other students. (Travis 62–3) The switch from on campus learning to holding classes entirely though video conferencing software has wrought havoc on class participation. Many students taking online classes never have their camera on, and some only turn it on for short periods of time. In most classes there are typically under five students with their camera on, no matter how large the class is. Yet, in some classes, the only person with their camera on is the professor. For Travis, “sometimes, no one turns their camera on or participates, it’s only me, but in their classes, more people turn the cameras, which is kind of nice.” (Travis 95) Travis stated that “I feel bad for the instructors sometimes when they are staring at a blank board. Sometimes it’s easier to interact and have a productive class session that mimics the tradition classroom experience by having my camera on” (Travis 100–103) For Victoria, in her “smaller classes, it’s me and like one or two other people who will turn on their camera, but most people are willing to participate.” (Victoria, 42–45) This highlights a strange new culture in the classroom, students who are too shy to participate with their video on or to use their voice but are willing to participate through the chat. Victoria finds that although in the main session most cameras are off, “in breakout rooms, most people do turn on their cameras, and I keep mine on. I participate a lot because no one else really does.” (Victoria, 88–91) As people become more accustomed to Zoom (and probably more desperate for social interactions), the culture around Zoom becomes more solidified in the concept that “if you are in a breakout room, you unmute yourself and turn on your camera. And I think that that’s like becoming a little bit more universal and that’s made it easier as well.” (Victoria 128–130) Both Travis and Victoria are motivated to have their camera on for similar reasons, to replicate the real Zoom experience. I find it strange that the two people that I interview seem to have their camera on a lot, yet most students still keep their cameras off for the majority of synchronous classes. Students seem to have two main motivators for participating and focusing during online classes. The first being the fact that it is “still paying full tuition for the classes for basically doing Khan Academy online. So, I might as well get the most of my learning experience.” (Travis, 133–135) The second being out of respect for the professors, because, again, students are paying to be there to learn from these professors. (Victoria 54) \")]),a(\"h2\",[e._v(\"DESIGN IMPLICATIONS\")]),a(\"p\",[e._v(\" More than anything, the findings of this study show how truly desolate the social arena looks for college students during the pandemic. Normally college life is typically filled with some of the most social interactions in a student’s developmental life. The decrease in social interactions, which impacts student focus, seems to hinge solely on the new limitations of the era: being stuck in your house due to the coronavirus pandemic, as well as the limitations of engagement that video conferencing services provide. These struggles highlight a key area for design improvement: how to make virtual interactions feel more real, and how to encourage student social interaction despite the barriers presented by online learning in the pandemic. This is a huge design opportunity for software industry professionals as they continue to create software and programs that will facilitate face to face interactions despite not being together in person. Some solutions such as Remo aim to mimic the in-person space by creating a bit of an RPG Pokémon-esque experience. This still utilizes video conferencing though which still limits the degree to which you can interact with other people and participants. Based on the truly astounding burnout that students are feeling towards Zoom, as well as the new standards of attending big lectures without your video on, the methods that are based solely on interaction over video camera seem to be a bit naïve. By understanding student focus participation and distraction, engineers can attempt to build classroom environments for better focusing for students. \")]),a(\"p\",[e._v(\" This research could also be used to inform the creation of curricula for future online classes, because it is very apparent that we probably will not be back together on campus until at least spring quarter 2021, but more realistically, students will not be back on campus until the fall of 2021. This research on what is distracting to students, and how students handle their focusing while learning from home, could be vital in making changes and accommodations to current class formats in order to be better suited for the online world. This could be through changing the class format from asynchronous to synchronous, changing the type of projects and assessments being given to students, and changing the way that students interact, or even by creating new methods and forums for class participation. \")]),a(\"h2\",[e._v(\"CONCLUSION\")]),a(\"p\",[e._v(\" The swift and disruptive changes that rocked the world at the start of the novel coronavirus Pandemic had caused intense drastic change in the way that college students attend class.

This study found that focus and learning from home was drastically impacted by four factors: the way in which student separated the space in their home to have distinct areas for study and focus as well as relaxation and decompression, as well as the decrease in accountability that students feel during virtual classes, focusing during class while it is online, changes in what it means to participate in class, and the large effects of zoom burnout.
