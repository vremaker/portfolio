This study sought to\n      understand the relationship between access to natural spaces, such as\n      parks, and the amount of crime in a given area. This study focused on two\n      conditions: high crime and high parks. High crime meant that there was a\n      higher percentage of crime than parks, while high parks meant there was a\n      higher percentage of parks than there was of crime.\n      <br /><br />\n      The first part of the study investigated the question: Do areas with more\n      greenspace have less crime? On average, the high crime condition had about\n      half the greenspace of the high park condition. On average, the high park\n      condition also had significantly less crime than the high crime condition.\n      This indicates that having more greenspace might have an impact on the\n      amount of crime.\n      <br /><br />\n      The second part of this study investigated the question: Does the the\n      quality of parks in the area affect the amount of crime? On average, the\n      high crime condition had a rating that was .6 lower than the high parks\n      condition. This indicates that when there are more parks in an area, they\n      are usually of higher quality.\n      <br /><br />\n      Although there was a relationship shown in this study, it is also critical\n      to consider other variables which might have an impact on this\n      relationship, namely: population in a neighborhood, size of the\n      neighborhood, socioeconomic status within a neighborhood, and the ratio of\n      stores, housing and natural space in a neighborhood.\n    </p>\n    <h2>Introduction and Background</h2>\n    <p>\n      People are highly impacted by the envrionment in which they live. We, as\n      humans, are inexplicably drawn to nature; which can have major effects on\n      our well being. Having access to nature both wild and domesticated has a\n      major impact on our mental health. For example, studies have shown that\n      joggers who exercise in nature feel more restored and have less\n      anxiety,than those who exerise at the gym (Louv, 35). Unfortunately,\n      having access to safe nature is not always achievable. By looking at the\n      accessibility of parks, as well as the quality of those parks, it is\n      possible to gain a better understanding of their impact within the greater\n      Seattle community.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      This study seeks to work along a similar framework to the broken window\n      thoery which uses the number of broken windows to guague the amount of\n      crime - more broken windows incidates higher rates of crime (Koglmeier).\n      But, instead of the number of broken windows, we will be using the number\n      of parks, as well as the quality of those parks.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Across all of the literature that I reviewed, a key factor in the\n      effectiveness of these parks and natural spaces - a key peice to making\n      these public spaces effective is the need for a human centered approach\n      with community engagement during the erection of these institutions\n      (Koglmeier,Green Space and Crime, Ross). It is the human centered\n      involvment in the development of these programs and spaces that makes the\n      difference in these harm reduction programs. These spaces are not a means\n      to an end in an of it self, but a proxy for community engagement (Ross).\n      This poses a difficult question within my research in which the ways in\n      which the databases I choose do not really include data about community\n      invovlement within the development of these areas. Similarly, in the\n      literature I reviewed, having greenspace does not automatically reduce\n      crime; instead, these parks need to be well maintained and must not have\n      hidden spots where crime could occur (Green Space and Crime). Luckily, in\n      the Greenspace database, there is a tier ranking of the parks from 1 - 6\n      in which 1 is the highest tier and 6 is the lowest tier. This ranking\n      scale could probably be used to mirror the quality of the park and more\n      deeply understand park quality as it relates to crime rates.\n    </p>\n    <h2>Research Questions and Hypotheses</h2>\n    <ul>\n      <li><b>RQ1: </b> Do areas with more greenspace have less crime?</li>\n      <li>\n        <b>H1: </b> I beleive that there will be less crime in areas with more\n        greenspace.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <b>RQ2: </b> Does the the quality of parks in the area affect the amount\n        of crime?\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <b>H2: </b> I believe that having higher quality parks will be an\n        indicator of less crime.\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n    <h2>Methods</h2>\n    <p>\n      Listed below are the steps that I took during my data analysis.

Then,\n        the data about the greenspace will be added to the 'hood_counts'\n        dictionary at the appropriate spot.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Query the Seattle Crime Database and checks the location of each crime\n        incient against the neighborhoods using geodata. Qualifying crime will\n        be done within the last 5 years (2017 - 2022). Then, the data about the\n        crimes will be added to the 'hood_counts' dictionary at the appropriate\n        spot.\n      </li>\n      <li>Calculates the average park rating for each neighborhood.</li>\n      <li>\n        Because the total number of crimes is going to be far higher than the\n        number of parks, it was important to creates a dictionary of the\n        hood_percentages which take the total number of crimes and parks for\n        each neighborhood and divides them by the total number of crime and\n        parks.

For each crime or park percentage, it is the total\n      number of crimes or parks in the neighborhood divded by the total number\n      of parks or crime in all of Seattle.\n    </p>\n    <img\n      src=\"assets/nature/all_hoods_compare.png\"\n      alt=\"neighborhood breakdown: percentage of overall crime and parks\"\n    />\n    <p>\n      As shown in 'Neighborhood Breakdown: Percentage of Overall Crime and\n      Parks' chart, we have a mix of neighborhoods in which the percentage of\n      crime is higher than the percentage of parks and vice versa. This means\n      that there might potentially be an impact of parks on reducing crime.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The next two charts make the same comparison of percentages of crime and\n      parks, but groups them together by whether there was a higher percentage\n      of parks or a higher percentage of crime.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      In this chart, we look at the neighborhoods where there are more parks.\n    </p>\n    <img\n      src=\"assets/nature/high_crime.png\"\n      alt=\"high crime breakdown percentage of overall crime and parks\"\n    />\n    <p>\n      In this chart, most neighborhoods have over 3% of the parks in Seattle and\n      8 of these neighborhoods had over 5% of the parks. The exception to this\n      is Seward park, which has 2.7% of the parks, but again, this could be due\n      to the size of the area. We also see that most neighborhoods in this\n      bracket have between 3% and 6% of the crime in Seattle.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      In this chart, we look at the neighborhoods where there is more crime.\n    </p>\n    <img\n      src=\"assets/nature/high_park.png\"\n      alt=\"high park breakdown: percentage of overall crime and parks\"\n    />\n    <p>\n      In this chart, most neighborhoods have under 3% of the parks in Seattle.\n      There are two exception of note. First, there is Capitol Hill, which has\n      about 6% of the parks, and Queen Anne which has about 4% of parks. We also\n      see that most neighborhoods have between 3% and 7% of the crime in\n      Seattle.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      There seems to be a slight difference here for the average range of crime\n      when the number of parks is concerned. To look into this more deeply, we\n      compared the average percentage of parks and crime across the conditions\n      of having a higher percentage of parks or having a higher percentage of\n      crime.\n    </p>\n    <img\n      src=\"assets/nature/average_percent_crime_parks.png\"\n      alt=\"high crime vs high parks: average percent of parks\"\n    />\n    <p>\n      This chart shows a pretty big disparity between the two conditions. In the\n      condition in which there is a higher amount of crime, the average\n      percentage of crimes is 6.1% which is about double the average percentage\n      of parks 3%. But, in the condition where there are more parks, the average\n      number of parks is far higher at 6.6%, and the average amount of crime\n      much lower at around .5%.\n      <br /><br />\n      <em\n        >This seems to indicate that having more parks does have a potential\n        association with a reduction in crime</em\n      >\n    </p>\n    <hr />\n    <b\n      >RQ2: Does the the quality of parks in the area affect the amount of\n      crime?</b\n    >\n    <p>\n      To begin this section, let's talk a little bit about what the park ratings\n      mean within the parks database. This rating system is on a scale from 1 -6\n      with a 1 being the best possible park, and 6 being the worst park.\n      <br /><br />\n      This chart comes from comparing the average park ratings across the\n      condition of having a higher percentage of parks when compared to crime.\n    </p>\n    <img\n      src=\"assets/nature/high_park_rating.png\"\n      alt=\"high park breakdown: average park rating\"\n    />\n    <p>\n      In the areas with more parks, there is also a better rating for the park,\n      and more diversity within the park rating averages. The best average\n      rating in this range is 2.3 and the worst average rating is 4.\n      <br /><br />\n      This chart shows the average rating for parks within a given neighborhood\n      in areas where there is a higher percentage crime than there is parks.\n    </p>\n    <img\n      src=\"assets/nature/high_crime_rating.png\"\n      alt=\"high crime breakdown: average park rating\"\n    />\n    <p>\n      As you can see, there is not a whole lot of variation across these\n      neighborhoods. The worst average park rating is 4.2 and the best rating is\n      3.6.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Our final analysis seeks to compare the average park rating across all\n      neighborhoods in the condition of having a higher percentage of crime than\n      parks and having a higher percentage of parks than crime.\n    </p>\n\n    <img\n      src=\"assets/nature/high_crime_rating.png\"\n      alt=\"average park rating based on distribution of park and crime\"\n    />\n    <p>\n      This chart shows that in the condition in which there is a higher\n      percentage of crime than parks the average park rating is 3.9. In the\n      condition in which there is a higher percentage of parks than crime, the\n      average park rating is 3.3. There is a .6 difference in the average rating\n      in which the areas with a higher percentage of parks tend to have overall\n      higher quality parks\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <em\n        >This might indicate that parks in areas which there is less crime also\n        have higher quality.\n      </em>\n    </p>\n\n    <h2>Discussion</h2>\n    <p>\n      This analysis seems to suggest an inverse correlational relationship\n      between the number and quality of parks and crime rates. In this case,\n      areas with more, higher quality parks see less crime.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <b>RQ1 asked Do areas with more greenspace have less crime? </b> We found\n      that on average, areas with a higher percentage of parks had drastically\n      less crime when compared to areas with higher percentages of crime that\n      had an smaller assortment of parks. <br /><br />\n      <b\n        >RQ2 asked Does the the quality of parks in the area affect the amount\n        of crime?</b\n      >\n      We concluded that on average, areas with a higher percentage of crime had\n      parks of lower quality when compared to areas with a higher percentage of\n      parks. <br /><br />\n      Both of my hypotheses were confirmed, and there does seem to be a\n      relationship between the amount of crime and the quality and accessibility\n      of nature in the city. But, this does not seek to prove causation. There\n      are several potential factors that could influence these results namely:\n    </p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        <b>Population within a neighborhood:</b> There are a lot of industrial\n        areas within Seattle which might not have that many people living in it,\n        which could be a reason for fewer, lower quality green spaces.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <b>Size of the neighborhood:</b> Not every neighborhood in Seattle is\n        the same size. The smaller neighborhoods might have less crime and fewer\n        parks simply because there is less space for them.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <b>Socioeconomic status within a neighborhood: </b> Those in lower\n        socioeconomic classes might not be afforded the \"nicer\" parks due to\n        strucutral injustice within our governing bodies and the ways in which\n        cities sometimes distribute funds based on the overall income of those\n        living in the neighborhoods. There could also be higher crime rates\n        becaues there are people making less, and they would not have the time\n        to visit the green spaces. We also tend to see more policing in areas of\n        lower socioeconomic status, which of course leads to higher rates of\n        crime being reported, but it does not necesarily mean that there is not\n        a similar amount of crime going on in the higher socioeconomic status\n        neighborhoods in which there is less police patroling.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <b>Ratio of stores, housing, and natural spaces in a neighborhood: </b\n        >One of the most noticable outliers for crime and green space was\n        downtown. Which might be an indicator that areas that have a higher\n        focus on retail have less of a need for green space because people can\n        go home to their neighborhoods, which might have more greenspace, when\n        they are done with their retail adventures. Or, it could also indicate\n        that these places of business present more opportunities for crime, such\n        as theft, which would be harder to do in a more residential area.\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>\n      It was really fascinating to look at the ways in which available natural\n      spaces varies within Seattle, and this sets a great foundation which could\n      potentially be the backbone for more research such as taking into account\n      the factors listed above in additional research. Or, to potentially set\n      the baseline for an ethnographic study which talks to people in these\n      neighborhoods to learn more about how residents relationships to nature\n      vary in the neighborhoods with a higher percentage of crime than parks and\n      those with a higher percentage of parks than crime.\n    </p>\n    <h2>Conclusion</h2>\n    <p>\n      Having access to natural greenspace can be very benefical to human health\n      and well being. But, not everyone has the same level of access to natural\n      spaces due to the ways in which society has been developed. This research\n      study sought to answer two questions: (1) Do areas with more greenspace\n      have less crime? (2) Do areas with more greenspace have less crime?\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      For research question 1, it was hypothesized there will be less crime in\n      areas with more greenspace. This hypothesis was confirmed when they study\n      found that on average, areas with a higher percentage of parks had\n      drastically less crime when compared to areas with higher percentages of\n      crime that had an smaller assortment of parks.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      For research question 2, it was hypothesized that having higher quality\n      parks will be an indicator of less crime. This hypothesis ws confirmed\n      when the study found that on average, areas with a higher percentage of\n      crime had parks of lower quality when compared to areas with a higher\n      percentage of parks.\n      <br /><br />\n      Of course, these finding do have some limitations. There are a lot of\n      other variables that might play into the reason that there is less crime\n      in areas with more parks and greenspace. The majors factors that might be\n      at play in this relationship are population in a neighborhood, size of the\n      neighborhood, socioeconomic status within a neighborhood, and the ratio of\n      stores, housing and natural space in a neighborhood. Further studies\n      should consider the impact of these factors. This may also serve as a call\n      to action to add set up areas in which having more, higher quality parks\n      added could potentially be beneficial.\n    </p>\n\n    <h2>Citations</h2>\n    <p>\n      Green Space and crime.
