This redesign started with user research, to understand the\r\n        audience of Seattle Public Transit in order to design for the actual\r\n        audience. Next, came the creation of six tasks that a user on Seattle\r\n        Public Transit would complete. Three of these tasks would be designed\r\n        for a mobile platform, and three of these tasks would be made for a\r\n        kiosk interaction which would be located at a transit stop. Next, there\r\n        were diagrams of user flows, to understand how the user would interact\r\n        with the system while completing their tasks. Then, we created low\r\n        fidelity wireframes to understand and test the layout of these\r\n        interactions. Then, we created mood boards and picked a typographic\r\n        hierarchy and a color scheme. Finally, we created high fidelity\r\n        wireframes which showcased the fully designed interactions.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <h2>USER RESEARCH</h2>\r\n      <p>\r\n        The Seattle public transit system is an integral part of the community\r\n        and has a multitude of considerations to design for. This user research\r\n        will describe Seattle public transit’s audience, purpose, platforms, the\r\n        current strength and weakness of the Seattle public transit system, and\r\n        an assessment of a public transit system with a better design framework.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <h3>Audience:</h3>\r\n      <p>\r\n        The audience of the Seattle public transit system includes many groups\r\n        of people. First, we have two sets of primary users. The first primary\r\n        user is regular people living in Seattle who use primarily public\r\n        transportation and walking to get around during their daily lives. -The\r\n        people using the service tend to be those with a lower income, because\r\n        public transportation is more affordable than owning a car, especially\r\n        in a city setting. On top of the primary users though, we see a large\r\n        number of stakeholders who are also affected by public transportation.\r\n        Because this transit system is funded by the government, that means that\r\n        our taxes partially go towards paying for this system. So, anyone who\r\n        pays taxes is going to be a stakeholder in the system. A few special\r\n        considerations to account for when considering the audience of public\r\n        transit is to remember the edge case users. There are a fair number of\r\n        disabled people who are in chairs or who have walkers that take the bus.\r\n        We also have homeless people riding the bus occasionally because it is\r\n        the cheapest and warmest thing to do in the cold Seattle winters. The\r\n        audience of public transit really does tend to be people who are\r\n        disadvantaged.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <h3>Purpose:</h3>\r\n      <p>\r\n        The purpose of the Seattle public transit system is to help people get\r\n        around the city/county. This is a service available to many people for a\r\n        fairly low cost all things considered, especially when you consider how\r\n        expensive it is to own a car in the city (spending 100+ dollars a month\r\n        for parking alone is just not affordable!) . If I wanted this brief to\r\n        be like 6 pages long, I would go on a rant about how public\r\n        transportation should be free, but I will digress. Secondary purposes\r\n        for this transit system include helping alleviate traffic congestion by\r\n        putting more people in one vehicle and reducing the number of cars on\r\n        the road. This is also a handy service for people who are not living in\r\n        Seattle but are in fact visiting Seattle as they travel between all of\r\n        the attractions in the area.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <h3>Seattle Transit System Assessment:</h3>\r\n      <p>\r\n        The biggest issue there seems to be with the Seattle public transit\r\n        system seems to be the distinct lack of cohesion between the multitude\r\n        of systems in place for public transportation. The main two are Link\r\n        Light Rail and King County Metro. But there are a number of other\r\n        smaller transit authorities including but not limited to: community\r\n        transit, the monorail, and water taxis. All of these systems seem to run\r\n        on the Orca card, but they are managed by a large number of I have\r\n        always been very confused as to why the Light Rail and the King County\r\n        Metro Bus system have very different aesthetics. The color for king\r\n        county metro is green yellow and red, which is an unappealing color\r\n        combo. While link uses a white and blue color scheme. Community transit,\r\n        another branch also follows the blue and white color scheme. The light\r\n        rails main flaw is that the tap on tap off system is kind of a pain to\r\n        use and the range of the light rail is very limited, but it is being\r\n        expanded. The buses have a very difficult payment system where you only\r\n        need to tap on. There are very few bus stops with kiosks to refill the\r\n        clipper card or buy tickets.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        I don’t love Seattle public transportation. I used it freshman year and\r\n        had some questionable experiences. But now I have a car in Seattle so I\r\n        don’t really ever use transit unless I am going from the U district to\r\n        downtown. I understand the system. I would change the system so that\r\n        both king county metro and link light rail have a consistent theme, look\r\n        and combined website. I would also make the west lake station more\r\n        easily understood. When you take a bus out of Westlake it is from the\r\n        same place you take the light rail. It is very confusing and should be\r\n        reworked so that the markings are more clear and more easily understood\r\n        and identified.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        When you search King County Metro in the App store, there is one app for\r\n        purchasing tickets and it gets very poor reviews, and only has about 150\r\n        reviews, so clearly it isn’t well integrated into the system.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <h2>THE BRAND BOOK</h2>\r\n      <iframe\r\n        src=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vSuMyi1mruFsmM0uAKm-q8twSFlh5YodbKU-cIheEAK3W4WVVzF2Wxgl2_z9mEyQKgbJaLn8LJ_9_9I/embed?start=false&loop=false&delayms=60000\"\r\n        frameborder=\"0\"\r\n        width=\"100%\"\r\n        height=\"auto\"\r\n        allowfullscreen=\"true\"\r\n        mozallowfullscreen=\"true\"\r\n        webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"\r\n      ></iframe>\r\n      <p>\r\n        This brand book shows the steps of the entire design process, from\r\n        creating a mood board and picking color schemes and typographic systems,\r\n        to diagraming user flows and creating low and high fidelity wireframes\r\n        for 3 interactions on a mobile device and 3 interactions on a kiosk\r\n        system.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <h2>REFLECTION</h2>\r\n      <p>\r\n        The most substantial take away from I went through a few iterations of\r\n        mood boards, as the foundation for the design process, before I settled\r\n        on a theme that inspired me. To explore the development of the new brand\r\n        aesthetic for Emerald City Transit’s, let’s take a look at the three\r\n        iterations of mood boards for this redesign project.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <img src=\"assets/transit/mb1.jpeg\" alt=\"neutral moodboard\" />\r\n      <p>\r\n        The first theme that I came up with for the redesign of Seattle Public\r\n        Transit, was “Calm for Commuters.” This idea stemmed from wanting to\r\n        make people’s commute easier, but I was feeling uninspired by the\r\n        concept of calm for commuter. I did however really enjoy the pink sunset\r\n        vibes from this mood board.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <img src=\"assets/transit/mb2.jpeg\" alt=\"green moodboard\" />\r\n      <p>\r\n        The second iteration of the mood board is where we see the introduction\r\n        of “Emerald City Transit.” I don’t even remember how it happen, but\r\n        something got me thinking about Wicked, and I felt inspired. I wanted to\r\n        add some fairytale whimsy to the users commute. But the monochromatic\r\n        theme in green seemed a bit aggressive to me.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <img src=\"assets/transit/mb3.png\" alt=\"green and pink moodboard\" />\r\n      <p>\r\n        The final iteration of the mood board is a culmination of the first two\r\n        mood boards. I took the pink accents from the calm for commuting mood\r\n        board and combined it with monochromatic green scheme from my first\r\n        iteration of the Emerald City Transit mood board. All things considered,\r\n        the final product from this public transit redesign would probably not\r\n        be incredible for a public transit system because it is so whimsical and\r\n        cities prefer a more clean, clear cut design.\r\n      </p>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </PortfolioPiece>\r\n</template>\r\n\r\n<script>\r\nimport PortfolioPiece from \"@/components/layouts/PortfolioPiece.vue\";\r\n\r\nexport default {\r\n  components: {\r\n    PortfolioPiece,\r\n  },\r\n};\r\n</script>\r\n"]}]}
