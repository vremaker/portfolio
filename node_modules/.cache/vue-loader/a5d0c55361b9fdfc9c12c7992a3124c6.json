Buddy</h1>\n      <p>\n        Exploratory prototyping for Crochet Buddy: an Internet of Things (IoT)\n        device created to assist novice crochet hobbyists in the pursuit of\n        beautiful yarn-craft.\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <hr />\n    <p>\n      In the Spring of 2020, around the start of the Novel Coronavirus Pandemic\n      that caused countries to shut down, I took up the art of crochet to fill\n      the days in isolation. Due to my inability to count my stitches correctly\n      in each of the rows I completed, the first blanket I made came out as more\n      of a trapezoid than a rectangle. The other big issue that most novice\n      crochet hobbyists is keeping a consistent tension in the amount that you\n      pull on the yarn to create each stitch. Crochet Buddy is an Internet of\n      Things (IoT) device created to assist novice crochet hobbyists in their\n      pursuit of beautiful yarn-craft. This project consisted of exploration in:\n      analog prototyping, 3D modeling, Voice User Interface, and AI stitch\n      tracking.\n    </p>\n    <img\n      class=\"p-0\"\n      src=\"assets/crochet-buddy/sketch.png\"\n      alt=\"crochet buddy sketch\"\n    />\n\n    <h2>Design Overview</h2>\n    <p>\n      The Crochet Buddy is a fairly simple IoT device with a large impact on\n      those who crochet. The physical device has three main components: an\n      ergonomic handle, a camera facing the crochet hook’s neck, which counts\n      the number of stitches and tracks which type of stitches are being made\n      using a machine learning algorithm. The hook also has a pressure sensitive\n      hook, which tracks the amount of force exerted each time the user pulls\n      for the stitch. The hook will also vibrate when the user should stop\n      pulling on the stitch, thus enforcing a consistent pull, making the\n      yarn-craft more consistent.\n    </p>\n    <iframe\n      width=\"100%\"\n      height=\"315\"\n      src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/X2v73GxMAIo\"\n      title=\"YouTube video player\"\n      frameborder=\"0\"\n      allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"\n      allowfullscreen\n    ></iframe>\n\n    <h2>Analog Prototype</h2>\n    <p>\n      The analog prototype for Crochet Buddy was made out of 3 ingredient clay\n      (made with flour, water, and salt) as well as a crochet hook that I had\n      lying around my room. I made the clay for the hook, and then wrapped it\n      around my hook around to form a handle. I then took and extra bit of clay\n      to figure out what the camera placement would look like. After the handle\n      was formed, I took it off of my crochet hook, and baked it until the clay\n      became sturdy. I then put the handle back on my crochet hook for user\n      testing. The first handle iteration is shown below.\n    </p>\n    <img\n      class=\"pt-0\"\n      src=\"assets/crochet-buddy/analog_1.jpeg\"\n      alt=\"crochet buddy sketch\"\n    />\n    <p>\n      I actually went through two prototypes while designing this hook. The\n      first prototype turned out to be far too bulky and big, so I created a\n      sleeker and smaller handle, which ended up being the better of the two, as\n      shown below.\n    </p>\n    <img\n      class=\"pt-0\"\n      src=\"assets/crochet-buddy/analog_2.jpeg\"\n      alt=\"crochet buddy sketch\"\n    />\n    <b>Analysis</b>\n    <p>\n      The grip that I created for my prototype makes holding the crochet hooks\n      that I have so much more comfortable, that I actually find myself using\n      the lo-fi prototype handle when I’m planning on crocheting for longer\n      periods of time. This is a testament to the biggest feature that I was\n      using my analog model to test for: comfort and grip positioning.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      During the analysis phase, I also took a video of what the camera would\n      see. This was to see if it was even possible to use machine learning to\n      track stitches in this way. It did prove that there is a distinct\n      possibility that machine learning for stitch counting in this way is a\n      distinct possibility.\n    </p>\n    <h2>3D Prototyping</h2>\n    <p>\n      The 3D model of Crochet Buddy was made in Onshape: a collaborative CAD\n      modeling program. I began the model as a sketch the front plane. This\n      sketch contained a half view of the side profile of Crochet Buddy’s main\n      form. As you can see, the sketch captures the rounded features of crochet\n      buddy which make it more comfortable to use.\n    </p>\n    <img\n      src=\"assets/crochet-buddy/3d_sketch.png\"\n      alt=\"line sketch for crochet buddy\"\n    />\n    <p>\n      Next, I use the revolve feature for the above sketch, to create the base\n      for Crochet Buddy. this lead to a very simple three-dimensional figure\n      that works as the base for Crochet Buddy.\n    </p>\n    <img\n      src=\"assets/crochet-buddy/3d_round.png\"\n      alt=\"revolve for crochet buddy\"\n    />\n    <p>\n      Once the main 3D form for Crochet Buddy was completed, I created a new\n      sketch, again on the front plane. These sketches are on the same plane to\n      ensure that the sketches overlap and can actually be used for extrudes.\n    </p>\n    <img\n      src=\"assets/crochet-buddy/3d_cut.png\"\n      alt=\"sketch for crochet hook cut\"\n    />\n    <p>\n      In order to create the cutout that makes up the hook for Crochet Buddy, I\n      used an extrude cut. The extrude cut took the material from the triangle\n      that I had sketched away from the hook. The more angular slanted nature of\n      the cutout for Crochet Buddy is based off of the angular style of Susan\n      Bates crochet hooks, which are objectively the easiest to work with. Most\n      others are too rounded, which makes it difficult to capture the loops that\n      are being pulled through to create a stitch.\n    </p>\n    <img\n      src=\"assets/crochet-buddy/3d_clear.png\"\n      alt=\"cut for crochet buddy hook\"\n    />\n    <p>\n      For the third time, I created a sketch on the front plane. This time, it\n      was nestled against the thick grip section of the handle, on top of the\n      beginning of the hook. This is the ideal placement because it is out of\n      the way for the user, and it has a pretty solid view down the neck of the\n      hook, which is the vantage point used for counting and tracking stitches.\n    </p>\n    <img\n      src=\"assets/crochet-buddy/3d_camera.png\"\n      alt=\"sketch for crochet buddy camera\"\n    />\n    <p>\n      To create the camera housing, based off of the initial sketch, I used an\n      extrude on the square. I extruded both to the left and to the right with\n      the sketch on the front plane as my “center point.” This allowed me to\n      make the camera housing evenly centered on the hook so that the camera\n      would have the clearest view down the hook’s neck.\n    </p>\n    <img\n      src=\"assets/crochet-buddy/3d_cam_col.png\"\n      alt=\"extrude for crochet buddy camera\"\n    />\n    <p>\n      Finally, to make the the 3D model more aesthetically pleasing and appear\n      to be more realistic, I used the appearance feature of Onshape to apply a\n      blue color to the hook part of Crochet Buddy. This blue color mimics the\n      standard color for 5mm crochet hooks.\n    </p>\n    <img\n      src=\"assets/crochet-buddy/3d_color.png\"\n      alt=\"final model for crochet buddy\"\n    />\n    <div class=\"text-center\">\n      <a\n        href=\"https://cad.onshape.com/documents/6fe367458e9e7df097cd1b08/w/c87550b82174ec9333dfbd76/e/b54d1e8d204f7130c8ada965\"\n        target=\"_blank\"\n        >You can view the 3D model here.</a\n      >\n    </div>\n    <b>Analysis</b>\n    <p>\n      Because I’ve taken classes on CAD modeling before, I am fairly content\n      with the decisions that I made to create the 3D model for Crochet Buddy.\n      The 3D model created in Onshape resembles my analog model very nicely. The\n      only real downfall of my prototype is that it is not fully constrained.\n      But, as you can see, the dimensions of the model appear to be correct.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Overall, I am incredibly proud of the 3D model for Crochet Buddy. but\n      there are definitely still areas for improvement. In the future, I would\n      probably do some deeper multi-piece assemblies with constraints in the\n      button interactions. I would include a button that would be used to\n      “indicate the end of the first line of stitches, and any other changes\n      made by the user while working on their piece. This would be located on\n      the trip of the handle. I would also possibly add a long thin button going\n      down the entire length of the hook, that would actually be what was used\n      to gauge the pressure in the pulls for each stitch.\n    </p>\n    <h2>Voice User Interface</h2>\n    <p>\n      Although Crochet Buddy has functionality for a crotchetier of any skill\n      levels, this iteration focuses on Crochet Buddy as a resource for total\n      beginners to learn crochet with real time feedback. Never again will a\n      novice crochetier be left wondering if they missed a step, misunderstood\n      the directions, or did something wrong. The design for the educational\n      aspect of crochet buddy has two main aspects:\n    </p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        An updated analog prototype which includes the ability to attach an\n        actual web camera to Crochet Buddy.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        The VUI which prompts users step by step how to crochet, by explaining\n        the steps to make a variety of stitches.\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n    <b>Goal</b>\n    <p>\n      From the start of my exploration into the development of Crochet buddy, I\n      had the idea in my head that novice a crochetier would be able to use it\n      as a platform to learn crochet, and to follow along with patterns from the\n      internet. The goal of this iteration is to gauge both the usability and\n      feasibility of learning using only a VUI alone, albeit one paired with\n      stitch tracking capabilities.\n    </p>\n    <b>Analog Prototype</b>\n    <p>\n      The analog model of Crochet Buddy followed a similar form to the original\n      Crochet Buddy hook. The biggest factor taken into account in this model\n      was the idea that I wanted the camera to have a full view of all of the\n      hook that was open to yarn. But, the focal length of my web camera was\n      super short, which meant that I had to cover a very large amount of the\n      hook in order for the camera to have this full perspective of the yarn on\n      the hook.\n    </p>\n    <img\n      class=\"pt-0\"\n      src=\"assets/crochet-buddy/vui_analog.png\"\n      alt=\"analog model for crochet buddy vui\"\n    />\n    <p>\n      Although the appearance of the new hook and handle is a lot bulkier, due\n      to my constraints, it definitely shows a very clean video feed. In the\n      video below, watch a user alternate between a single and double croceht\n      stitch from Crochet Buddy's perspective.\n    </p>\n    <iframe\n      width=\"100%\"\n      height=\"315\"\n      src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hkRtghFuSuI\"\n      title=\"YouTube video player\"\n      frameborder=\"0\"\n      allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"\n      allowfullscreen\n      class=\"pb-1\"\n    ></iframe>\n\n    <p>\n      In future iterations (with a higher budget), I would look into smaller,\n      wireless cameras with a wider lens to be integrated into a the hook in a\n      cleaner fashion.\n    </p>\n\n    <b>VUI Interaction</b>\n    <p>\n      Below, you can find the scripts for the VUI interactions that have been\n      crafted for each of the stitches for the crocheter to learn. This script\n      goes over a whole tutorial, teaching the user the chain stitch, the double\n      crochet, and the triple crochet. But, these can also be taught\n      individually upon request.\n    </p>\n    <p><b>USER:</b> Crochet Buddy, I want a crochet tutorial.</p>\n    <p><b>CB:</b> Start.</p>\n    <b>Chain Stitch</b>\n    <iframe\n      src=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vS57b9b9vWJZdVvoVI8aO0s2QSPVGMXMa1eADhaCUYHp60UC7zbC2Q-4Mo9CsFj7QMuqJVXrLycQiUD/embed?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000\"\n      frameborder=\"0\"\n      width=\"100%\"\n      height=\"350\"\n      allowfullscreen=\"true\"\n      mozallowfullscreen=\"true\"\n      webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"\n      class=\"pb-1\"\n    ></iframe>\n    <p>\n      <b>CB:</b> To begin, let’s make a slip knot.

You have learned the double crochet. You are now at the point where you can start making crochet items!</p>\n    <div class=\"text-center\">\n      <a\n        href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sw-pY2WbI3VCdQqk_Mk5MY1IYT0yUQpTpH7eHamClxk/edit?usp=sharing\"\n        target=\"_target\"\n        >You can view the document with all the VUI scripts here.</a\n      >\n    </div>\n    <b>Demo</b>\n    <p>\n      The final aspect of Crochet Buddy was the demo video, which showcases the\n      VUI and stitch tracking camera working together to deliver an easy and\n      seamless way to learn crochet!\n    </p>\n    <iframe\n      width=\"100%\"\n      height=\"315\"\n      src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pvUAqp3lwj4\"\n      title=\"YouTube video player\"\n      frameborder=\"0\"\n      allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"\n      allowfullscreen\n    ></iframe>\n    <b>Evaluation</b>\n    <p>\n      When I was initially thinking about Learning with Crochet Buddy, I wanted\n      to include a Graphical User Interface (GUI) with the VUI so that the user\n      would be able to see what they are supposed to be doing, in addition to\n      hearing it from the VUI, while they are doing it. But, I also wanted to\n      see how feasible it would be to learn Crochet by voice alone. To test the\n      VUI’s effectiveness on it’s own, I ran a VUI usability test with my mom\n      over Zoom. Because the Crochet Hook that my mom was using was poorly made\n      and almost impossible to use, we decided to skip over the triple crochet\n      section of the tutorial script.\n    </p>\n    <iframe\n      width=\"100%\"\n      height=\"315\"\n      src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/02jf-K-xQZQ\"\n      title=\"YouTube video player\"\n      frameborder=\"0\"\n      allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"\n      allowfullscreen\n    ></iframe>\n    <p>\n      The main findings from this evaluation was that knowing the number of\n      stitches that need to be on the hook is important information for the\n      user, when they are learning any crochet stitch, even if Crochet Buddy is\n      tracking it for them. It seems to be critical to the learning process for\n      the user to either have a view of what the state of the yarn should look\n      like as a picture, or to know the number of loops that should be on the\n      hook at any given time.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      It also became incredibly apparent that in any future iterations of\n      Crochet Buddy it is important to only use the\n      <a\n        href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Susan-Bates-Silvalume-Crochet-Pouch/dp/B000XZYISM\"\n        target=\"_blank\"\n        >Susan Bates Hooks</a\n      >, which are the most well loved hooks in the world of crochet. The other\n      generic crochet hooks just did not work very effectively, and made it\n      incredibly difficult for my mother to even attempt the steps Crochet Buddy\n      was giving her.\n    </p>\n\n    <b>Analysis</b>\n    <p>\n      Although the analog prototype shows how effective the vantage point of\n      having a camera embedded in the hook of Crochet Buddy’s handle is, the web\n      camera that I used for this analog prototype proved to be bulky and had a\n      very narrow view point. The bulky clip on the camera made it very\n      difficult to hold the analog prototype, while the narrow camera angle made\n      it so that there could only be a very small portion of the hook open for\n      yarn in order for the camera to view all the loops on the hook.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The next steps in furthering the Crochet Buddy analog design would be the\n      use of a smaller camera with a wider lens that does not interfere with the\n      quality and comfort of the handle grip of Crochet Buddy. It would be\n      mounted in such a way where it would be angled to see a bigger portion of\n      the crochet hook.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The VUI combined with stitch tracking also hold promise. From the demo\n      video, it is clear that having live feedback from Crochet Buddy, with\n      limited vocal interactions, could be an easy and fun way to learn crochet.\n      The biggest change to the VUI would be to add an additional sentence to\n      each of the lines that the VUI gives, stating the number of loops that\n      should be on the hook at any given time. Although I thought having Crochet\n      Buddy’s stitch tracking would be enough to help the user, my testing it\n      proved that the user would like to know the number of loops that should be\n      on the hook. Having the VUI state the number of loops there should be\n      proves effective then it would be able to be distributed without\n      connection to an app. Future iterations of Crochet Buddy would also\n      instructions for more stitches than the three stitches used for this\n      prototype. I would also change the script to possibly include more crochet\n      specific terms. When I was writing my scripts this time around I was\n      trying to use words that maybe were more descriptive, but given my user\n      testing and evaluation I believe having the more specific terms would be\n      more effective, especially if there is a way for users to interact with\n      Crochet Buddy to find out the definitions of the more niche crochet terms\n      if they aren’t obvious enough.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The next step for Crochet Buddy’s learning and educational systems would\n      be the creating of a mobile application which would integrate a GUI into\n      the pre-existing VUI and stitch tracking capabilities of Crochet Buddy.\n      This would enable users to have both audio and visual instructions in\n      their real time feedback. This application interface would also make it\n      possible t get rid of the audio feedback entirely and focus on written or\n      picture instructions which use on screen prompts and stitch tracking to\n      provide live feedback even when the user doesn’t want audio.\n    </p>\n     <div class=\"d-flex flex-column flex-md-row text-center justify-content-between\">\n        <router-link to=\"/common-ground\"><b>Previous Project: </b> Common Ground</router-link>\n        <router-link to=\"/nature\"><b>Next Project: </b>Access to Nature and Crime</router-link>\n        \n        </div>\n  </PortfolioPiece>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nimport PortfolioPiece from \"@/components/layouts/PortfolioPiece.vue\";\n\nexport default {\n  components: {\n    PortfolioPiece,\n  },\n};\n</script>\n<style scoped>\n</style>"]}]}
