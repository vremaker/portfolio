During our initial stakeholder meeting with Chime, we learned\n      that their users know what they have but feel they can’t build wealth. So,\n      we decided to focus our solution on users living paycheck to paycheck,\n      which we defined as those who make under $75,000 a year. Over the course\n      of twenty weeks, our project team planned, researched, and designed a\n      financial literacy application that draws upon users own finances as a baseline \n      for their learning experience. The final application was awarded an honorable\n      mention in the DEI category during the final capstone showcase.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      To motivate our design process, we used began by developing the following research \n      and design questions:\n      </p>\n      <b>Research Questions:</b>\n      <ul>\n        <li>What categories of financial literacy are most useful to users?</li>\n        <li>What does financial literacy mean to users?</li>\n        <li>What is the easiest way for someone to build wealth?</li>\n        <li>How do you move from paycheck to paycheck to accumulate wealth?</li>\n        <li>\n          What are the differences in the knowledge base between those who have \n          financial literacy and those who do not?\n        </li>\n        <li>Why are users feel motivated to learn about finances?</li>\n        <li>What are the most effective ways to engage users on financial literacy?</li>\n        <li>How do people avoid and escape debt? </li>\n      </ul>\n      <b>Design Questions: </b>\n      <ul>\n        <li>\n          How can we make financial literacy education more quick, fun, and accessible \n          and help build individuals’ wealth? \n        </li>\n        <li>\n          Do we design financial literacy education within users’ finance tools or \n          outside of it? \n        </li>\n      </ul>\n\n    <h2>User Research</h2> \n    <p>\n      To begin, we conducted several rounds of user research.

Initially, we intended for both Mark and Laura to be primary users, but after\n      a meeting with our stakeholders, we choose to focus on Mark as our primary user persona and using Laura as a secondary user. \n      During our research, we noticed that a lot of the issues between our older and younger users were fairly similar. We realized that we \n      wanted to focus our design in intervening earlier so that the newer users don't fall into the same trap that our older users \n      did in their youth. Because our focus was on Mark, we decided to focus a large portion our design motivation around the goal of \n      understanding and paying off student debt. \n    </p>\n    <div  class=\"d-flex flex-column justify-content-between\">\n      <div class=\"horiz\">\n        <img src=\"assets/fin-lit/mark.png\" alt=\"Mark Persona\"/>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"horiz\">\n        <img src=\"assets/fin-lit/laura.png\" alt=\"Laura Persona\"/>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <h3>User Journey Maps</h3>\n    <p>\n      After creating personas, we made two user journey maps to highlight the experiences that our users have with financial literacy. \n      Mark's journey map has a huge focus on social media financial literacy, advice from parents, and stress about money along \n      with a lack of understanding of how credit and debit work. Laura's journey has a focus on providing for her family, gaining \n      skills to make money, protecting her finances from overdraft fees, and getting advice from her bank about her finances.\n    </p> \n    <div  class=\"d-flex flex-lg-row flex-column justify-content-between\">\n      <div class=\"horiz\">\n        <img src=\"assets/fin-lit/mark_jm.png\" alt=\"Mark Map\"/>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"horiz\">\n        <img src=\"assets/fin-lit/laura_jm.png\" alt=\"Laura Map\"/>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <h2>Ideation</h2> \n    <p>After our user research, we began to create problem statements and design goals to center our ideation. </p>\n    <b>Problem Statements</b>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Users often feel overwhelmed, lost, or intimidated knowing how to start learning about finances</li>\n      <li>Users lack the motivation to practice financial literacy</li>\n      <li>Financial practices like 401k or savings are abstract and can be difficult for users to visualize the benefits </li>\n      <li>\n        Users are given advice that is not impactful to their current experience and suffers from \"shouldism\" for example \"I should be \n        investing\" or \"I should be in crypto\"\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n    <b>Design Goals</b>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        Balance giving the user impactful knowledge but also allowing them to explore various financial interests. \n        We call this Free-range design vs. Paternal design.\n      </li>\n      <li>Leave users feeling confident in their financial knowledge and the progress they are making in their learning</li>\n      <li>Provide valuable information to help them here and now</li>\n      <li>Clearly present information that is valuable to them using visual representations</li>\n      <li>Create a trusting and non-judgemental learning environment</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>\n      After coming together to create these design goals, it was time to start generating ideas about what tools might be helpful in the \n      creation of a financial literacy application. To address this, we went through several design activities to scope out our solution \n      space this involved: crazy 8's, storyboarding, and the creation of workflows.\n    </p>\n    <h3>Crazy 8's</h3>\n    <p>\n      To begin our ideation, we wanted to generate as many ideas a possible. In order to do this most effectively, we choose to \n      do crazy 8s We each did crazy-8's on our own, and then posted our work in the team FigJam. We then divided up each \n      crazy-8's document into individual screens and grouped the screens based on functionality to decide where the team had the \n      most overlap in their ideation. We came up with a variety of categories: onboarding, progress dashboard, learning simulation, \n      lesson layout, testing content, resource locators, resource helpers, and financial calculators. With this overview of ideas, \n      we then entered the storyboarding phase in which we took these ideas and thought about what those might look like for our users. \n    </p>\n    <img src=\"assets/fin-lit/crazy8.png\" alt=\"crazy 8s\" />\n    <h3>Storyboards</h3>\n    <p>\n      Following our crazy 8's and a review of user research from previous weeks, we created storyboards to explore \n      how potential problem-solving ideas would be accessed by our personas. \n    </p>\n    <img src=\"assets/fin-lit/storyboards.png\" alt=\"storyboards\" />\n    <p>\n      <b>Results:</b> \n      Storyboarding helped us identify how we can fit key features into an app format. It also helped us imagine when and where users \n      would need these features. This gave us some direction in our Information Architecture helping us decide which ideated features \n      to include, as well as in what order these features should appear in our applications hierarchy. \n    </p>\n    <h3>User Workflows</h3> \n    <p>\n      We began our wireframes with the design kit created by Chime. For this first iteration, we focused on onboarding processes, \n      knowledge checks and lesson  plans. The workflow diagrams served as the blueprint for our wireframes. However, as we prototyped \n      more and discussed as a group, we later changed certain aspects of our design. Critiquing the workflow diagrams as a group led \n      us to refine ideas more and to decide which ideas were supported by our codebook and persona's needs. \n    </p>\n    <img src=\"assets/fin-lit/workflow.png\" alt=\"storyboards\" />\n    <h2>Design and Iteration</h2>\n    <p>\n      In the design of our final application, we went through three rounds of iteration, which are highlighted below. In this \n      process, we were able to refine our scope, and focus on features that would be the most helpful for our users! \n    </p>    \n    <h3>Iteration 1: Onboarding and Lessons</h3>\n    <p> We began our wireframes with the design kit created by Chime. For this first iteration, we focused on onboarding processes, knowledge checks and lesson  plans.\n    <img  class=\"screen\"  src=\"assets/fin-lit/phone_verify.jpg\" alt=\"phone verification\"/>\n    <b>Text Verification of User Identity </b>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Make sure the user is real</li>\n      <li>Allow users to access information and lessons from various platforms</li>\n      <li>reduce the number of times the user has to enter demographic information </li>\n    </ul>\n    <img class=\"screen\" src=\"assets/fin-lit/basic_info.jpg\" alt=\"demographic collection\"/>\n    <b>Collecting Demographic Information</b> \n    <ul>\n      <li>Inform the delivery of a customized experience.</li>\n      <li>Match the race/ethnicity of the presenter to the user to form that sense of trust. </li>\n      <li>Enable recommendation of lessons and activities related to the user's needs.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <img  class=\"screen\" src=\"assets/fin-lit/fin_acct.png\"  alt=\"finances overview\" />\n    <b>Linking Financial Accounts</b>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Link user's financial accounts in one place to get the most accurate overview of their finances. </li>\n      <li>Address skepticism of linking accounts by allowing both account linkage and manual entry of information.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <img  class=\"screen\" src=\"assets/fin-lit/lifestyle.jpg\" alt=\"lifestyle\"/>\n    <b>Lifestyle and Habit Details</b>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Understand user lifestyle to make realistic learning recommendations to motivate continued learning.</li>\n      <li>Allow multi-selection for the topics the user is interested in learning.</li>\n      <li>Garner information about current financial hygine habits to tailor lessons to improve current habits.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <img  class=\"screen\" src=\"assets/fin-lit/checkpoint.jpg\" alt=\"quiz\" />\n    <b>Knowledge Check</b>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Eliminate repetitive lessons by determining user's current financial knowledge by assessing knowledge through an initial check-in.</li>\n      <li>This check in quiz will contain a variety of questions across the wide range of topics offered within our curriculum.</li>\n      <li>If the user wishes not to take this quiz, it is easy to skip.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <img  class=\"screen\" src=\"assets/fin-lit/lesson.jpg\" alt=\"lessons\"/>\n    <b>Lesson Learning</b> \n    <ul>\n      <li>Provide a clear visual path for users to start learning finances.</li>\n      <li>Each item on the learning map covers one topic the user should learn. </li>\n      <li>When a topic is clicked on, the user enters an overview of the sub-topic lesson plan</li>\n      <li>Because people trust information from those they relate to, we intend to share relevant stories based on information shared in onboarding.</li>\n      <li>Lessons are presented both in video format with a transcript that autoscrolls, for accessibility.</li> \n      <li>Each lesson is followed by short quizzes inspired by apps like Zogo and Duolingo</li>\n      <li>The experience concludes with a celebration and a progress view of where they are on their personalized learning path.</li> \n    </ul>\n    <h3>User Test 1</h3>\n    <p>\n      Financial literacy is a very personal topic, and we wanted to see user responses \n      to the features that we had created.

One of the biggest areas \n    for growth  that we came across in our end product was the quality and depth of \n    the lessons. We think that in order to better develop these lessons and ideas, \n    an important next step would be to focus on UX writing and content strategy to \n    more effectively present the financial literacy content to our users. Although \n    the content we present is helpful, it may not be portrayed in the cleanest way, \n    and there is definitely room for improvement. \n  </p>\n  <p>\n    We also ended our final design journey with a user testing session. Although we \n    got decent reviews from our users, there was still a large amount of feedback \n    which would help us improve our application. I am most excited about the inclusion \n    of how much money has been put towards your goal at the top of the goal details \n    page to show how much progress has been made towards the goal to motivate the \n    user to make more  progress towards their goals. There was also a lot of improvements \n    to be made to the lessons within our application. Although the content was solid, \n    the layout could definitely use more reworking. We would add more color and engagement \n    factors within the application, and would work to make the screens full of less text.  \n  </p>\n  <p> \n    If we were continue down this project, we would also want to create more screens \n    and flows for our users learning experience such as the prototyping out the savings \n    flow, budgeting flow, custom goal flow, and more content for the lessons that are \n    available in the skill builder section. We then, obviously would perform more user \n    testing and iterations upon our product with users who are working paycheck to paycheck.  \n  </p>\n  <h2>Reflection</h2>\n  <p>\n    This capstone project was a great experience. I was really worried at the start of this \n    project to be designing for financial literacy when I really did not know very much \n    about financial literacy myself. During our interview process, our intended user \n    groups had just about as much financial literacy awareness as we did. One of the \n    biggest barriers, especially among the college students was the lack of stable \n    income as a student. In our interviews with the older generation of users had a \n    lot of insights about what happens when you neglect financial literacy, and it \n    also gave me insight into the pains associated with debt, especially for those in \n    lower incomes. It was in our interview with the financial professor at UW that we \n    were able to start to learn financial literacy, which was a key facet to having \n    successful designs. I personally talked to my dad about financial literacy for the \n    first time during this project. He seemed really excited that  I was interest in \n    learning financial literacy and I'm grateful that this project allowed me to increase \n    my financial literacy skills. It also motivated me to continue my own financial literacy \n    journey after this project is complete.\n  </p>\n\n    <div class=\"d-flex flex-column flex-md-row text-center justify-content-center justify-content-lg-end\">\n        <router-link to=\"/on-trak\"><b>Next Project: </b>OnTrak Troubleshooting</router-link>\n      </div>\n\n  </PortfolioPiece>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nimport PortfolioPiece from \"@/components/layouts/PortfolioPiece.vue\";\n\nexport default {\n  components: {\n    PortfolioPiece,\n  },\n};\n</script>\n<style scoped style=\"scss\">\n.chart {\n  padding: 0;\n}\n/*\n.horiz {\n  display: flex;\n  flex-flow: column;\n  width: 49%;\n}*/\n@media screen and (max-width: 992px) {\n  .horiz {\n    display: flex;\n    flex-flow: column;\n    width: 100%;\n    padding-bottom: 10px;\n  }\n}\n\n.c {\n  text-align: center;\n  font-weight: bold;\n  margin-bottom: 5px;\n}\n\n.screen {\n  display: block;\n  width: 80%;\n  margin: auto;\n}\n</style>"]}]}
