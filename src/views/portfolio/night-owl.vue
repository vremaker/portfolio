      <h1>Night Owl</h1>
      <h3>Keeping Students Safe At Night</h3>

      <p>
        This project spanned 11 weeks in our HCDE 318 (Introduction to User
        Centered Design) course, in Autumn 2019. As a team of 4, we applied the
        user centered design process to the problem area of the danger of
        walking alone at night for students. The process culminated in a mobile
        application called Night Owl that gives students confidence and control
        when walking alone at night.
      </p>

      <h3>PROBLEM STATEMENT</h3>
      <p>
        University District is known to be a sketchy neighborhood. For example,
        the Safeway northwest of campus is fondly called “Sketchway” by
        students. This brings up the concern that walking near campus at night
        can be dangerous for students; students should not have to be concerned
        with their safety when walking around their university. This problem
        resonates with our team and peers, which is why we wanted to tackle the
        area of how to help students feel safe and confident walking near UW’s
        campus during night.”
      </p>

      <h3>INTERVIEWS</h3>
      <p>
        Our research consisted of three different methods: semi-structured
        interview, “fly on the wall” observation, and competitive analysis.
        Through these methods, we learned more about our user group and their
        goals and pain points as well as other products already on the market.
        Each team member conducted a one-on-one interview with a student at the
        University of Washington that walks during dusk or at night at least 4
        times a month. We then regrouped and synthesized our findings into key
        takeaways that would help us define our problem space and user group.
      </p>

      <h4>Key Takeaways:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          They felt more comfortable talking with a friend on the phone when
          walking alone
        </li>
        <li>Walking home alone is unavoidable</li>
        <li>They know about UW safety, but doesn’t know how it works</li>
        <li>They are very aware of their surroundings</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>OBSERVATIONS</h3>
      <p>
        Next, as a team we performed a “fly on the wall” observation on the Ave.
        The goal of this study was to observe and investigate the actions and
        behaviors of students walking in the U District at night.

      <h3>COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</h3>
      <p>
        Each team member conducted one competitive analysis on an existing
        safety app. This allowed us to understand how existing products on the
        market meet users’ needs and how they could be improved. We analyzed the
        apps BSafe, Circle of 6, Sekura, and Noonlight. Overall, the apps all
        had streamlined designs that generally made users feel safe, but also
        had shortcomings such as confusing features and allowing users to easily
        trigger emergency services on accident. We used this information to seek
        opportunities, inspire our designs, and learn what to avoid.

      <h3>USER PERSONAS</h3>
      <p>
        From our interviews, we gathered key insights on our users that we
        compiled into categories such pain points, desires, and goals. These
        helped us create personas grounded in data in order to avoid stereotypes
        and assumptions. We chose to create two personas: one that was more
        experienced with the U-District area and one that was only semi-familiar
        with the area. This let us understand different user perspectives. Our
        personas were a home base that we frequently visited to realign our
        product and goals to our users’ needs.

      <h3>USER JOURNEY MAPS</h3>
      <p>
        Our user journey maps represent the experiences of Amanda and Mallory,
        two of our users, while walking home at night. We captured key touch
        points between her and her environment and emotions throughout her walk
        home. We focused on anxiety, alertness, and confidence as the emotions
        we wanted to track, because they were the most prevalent emotions of our
        interviewees. This journey map helped us understand our user’s feelings
        and interactions while walking home.

      <h3>DESIGN REQUIREMENTS</h3>
      <p>
        After better understanding our users and problem space through research,
        we defined design requirements that outlined the functions of our
        application. These requirements ensured that our solution solved user
        pain points and satisfied their goals. In addition, they helped us
        decide to focus on creating a phone app as our final product because it
        would be able to fulfill the requirements. This would also be convenient
        for our users since we observed that many of them interacted with their
        phone in some way while walking at night.

      <h3>STORYBOARDS</h3>
      <p>
        Each team member created two storyboards: one sketched and one photo or
        photo hybrid. Each storyboard showed a specific scenario of our user
        interacting with our potential product. It helped us visualize how our
        user would interact with our potential solution. We chose to have each
        team member focus on different user scenarios in order for us to
        understand the full picture of the interactions between the user and our
        product from the start to end of their walk.

      <h3>INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE</h3>
      <p>
        After deciding to make an app as our product, we started brainstorming
        key features that would be the most helpful to our users. We utilized
        our design requirements and user personas when ideating the app’s
        features and how users would go through a specific task. Overall, our
        information architecture showed the relationships and flows between each
        feature. This set us up for success as we started ideating and creating
        paper prototypes of our app screens.
      </p>
      <img src="assets/night-owl/ia.png" alt="information architecture" />
      <h3>PAPER PROTOTYPING USABILITY TESTING</h3>
      <p>
        The paper prototypes were a quick, easy way to test our designed
        features without distracting users with colors and photos. They helped
        us pinpoint confusing and unintuitive aspects of our initial features,
        which we incorporated into our redesign. First, we each individually
        sketched and described three interfaces. Then, we came back together and
        combined our rough draft sketches into consistent interface sketches for
        our usability tests. Based on our storyboards and information
        architecture diagram, we defined three key tasks that we asked users to
        complete in our tests.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Task 1:</em>User searches for a final destination, which will be
        home. Then they will select the path that they want to take and start
        their route.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Task 2:</em>User reports a burglary incident and inputs the correct
        information (date, time, description) and submits it. After submitting,
        check that it was successfully added to the map.
      </p>
      <p><em>Task 3:</em>User adds new safety contact and then calls them.</p>
      <h4>Participants:</h4>
      <p>
        We tested our prototype with four female University of Washington
        students who walk alone at night at least once a week.
      </p>
      <h4>Method:</h4>
      <p>
        For each evaluation, we followed three major phases of testing in order
        to cohesively gather quality information about our users and our app.
        The first phase started off with an interview with each participant in
        order to gather basic demographic information. The second phase
        consisted of the main usability testing by providing users with a task
        that they had to accomplish while observers recorded notes. During the
        test, we asked participants to think out loud so that we could better
        understand their thought process and pain points. To make it seem like a
        real application, we used a Marvel App to conduct our usability testing.
        Lastly, we performed a post test interview to get final details of what
        participants thought of their experience of our solution to night
        safety. After individually completing our usability tests, we came back
        together to synthesize and analyze our findings. We found commonalities
        in the features users struggled with, strengths and weaknesses of our
        design, and suggestions for redesign.
      </p>
      <h4>Key Findings</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Users wanted to be able to share their location even when they hadn’t
          started a path.
        </li>
        <li>
          Users did not expect the app to immediately call a contact after
          clicking on their contact tile.
        </li>
        <li>
          Users want to be able to quickly input information when reporting a
          hazard.
        </li>
        <li>
          Users stated that hazards have different urgency levels, which should
          be reflected in the app.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>REFINEMENTS</h3>
      <p>
        Based on our findings from our usability tests we made some changes to
        our designs. Below are the three main changes that we made based on user
        feedback.
      </p>
      <h4>Report a Hazard:</h4>
      <img src="/assets/night-owl/report.png" alt="report a hazard" />
      <p>
        Having different icon categories and hazard types was confusing, but users still wanted hazards to be differentiated in some way. We made a few changes based on this feedback:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Removed different icon types and only allowed users to report hazards</li>
          <li>Removed hazard types</li>
          <li>Allowed users to enter a title for the hazard</li>
          <li>Added hazard levels (low, medium, and high danger)</li>
          </ul>
