      <h1>Night Owl</h1>
      <p class="subhead" >Keeping Students Safe At Night</p>

      <p>
        This project spanned 11 weeks in our HCDE 318 (Introduction to User
        Centered Design) course, in Autumn 2019. As a team of 4, we applied the
        user centered design process to the problem area of the danger of
        walking alone at night for students. The process culminated in a mobile
        application called Night Owl that gives students confidence and control
        when walking alone at night.
      </p>

      <h2>PROBLEM STATEMENT</h2>
      <p>
        University District is known to be a sketchy neighborhood. For example,
        the Safeway northwest of campus is fondly called “Sketchway” by
        students. This brings up the concern that walking near campus at night
        can be dangerous for students; students should not have to be concerned
        with their safety when walking around their university. This problem
        resonates with our team and peers, which is why we wanted to tackle the
        area of how to help students feel safe and confident walking near UW’s
        campus during night.”
      </p>

      <h2>INTERVIEWS</h2>
      <p>
        Our research consisted of three different methods: semi-structured
        interview, “fly on the wall” observation, and competitive analysis.
        Through these methods, we learned more about our user group and their
        goals and pain points as well as other products already on the market.
        Each team member conducted a one-on-one interview with a student at the
        University of Washington that walks during dusk or at night at least 4
        times a month. We then regrouped and synthesized our findings into key
        takeaways that would help us define our problem space and user group.
      </p>

      <h3>Key Takeaways:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          They felt more comfortable talking with a friend on the phone when
          walking alone
        </li>
        <li>Walking home alone is unavoidable</li>
        <li>They know about UW safety, but doesn’t know how it works</li>
        <li>They are very aware of their surroundings</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>OBSERVATIONS</h2>
      <p>
        Next, as a team we performed a “fly on the wall” observation on the Ave.
        The goal of this study was to observe and investigate the actions and
        behaviors of students walking in the U District at night.

      <h2>COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</h2>
      <p>
        Each team member conducted one competitive analysis on an existing
        safety app. This allowed us to understand how existing products on the
        market meet users’ needs and how they could be improved. We analyzed the
        apps BSafe, Circle of 6, Sekura, and Noonlight. Overall, the apps all
        had streamlined designs that generally made users feel safe, but also
        had shortcomings such as confusing features and allowing users to easily
        trigger emergency services on accident. We used this information to seek
        opportunities, inspire our designs, and learn what to avoid.

      <h2>USER PERSONAS</h2>
      <p>
        From our interviews, we gathered key insights on our users that we
        compiled into categories such pain points, desires, and goals. These
        helped us create personas grounded in data in order to avoid stereotypes
        and assumptions. We chose to create two personas: one that was more
        experienced with the U-District area and one that was only semi-familiar
        with the area. This let us understand different user perspectives. Our
        personas were a home base that we frequently visited to realign our
        product and goals to our users’ needs.

      <h2>USER JOURNEY MAPS</h2>
      <p>
        Our user journey maps represent the experiences of Amanda and Mallory,
        two of our users, while walking home at night. We captured key touch
        points between her and her environment and emotions throughout her walk
        home. We focused on anxiety, alertness, and confidence as the emotions
        we wanted to track, because they were the most prevalent emotions of our
        interviewees. This journey map helped us understand our user’s feelings
        and interactions while walking home.

      <h2>DESIGN REQUIREMENTS</h2>
      <p>
        After better understanding our users and problem space through research,
        we defined design requirements that outlined the functions of our
        application. These requirements ensured that our solution solved user
        pain points and satisfied their goals. In addition, they helped us
        decide to focus on creating a phone app as our final product because it
        would be able to fulfill the requirements. This would also be convenient
        for our users since we observed that many of them interacted with their
        phone in some way while walking at night.

      <h2>STORYBOARDS</h2>
      <p>
        Each team member created two storyboards: one sketched and one photo or
        photo hybrid. Each storyboard showed a specific scenario of our user
        interacting with our potential product. It helped us visualize how our
        user would interact with our potential solution. We chose to have each
        team member focus on different user scenarios in order for us to
        understand the full picture of the interactions between the user and our
        product from the start to end of their walk.

      <h2>INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE</h2>
      <p>
        After deciding to make an app as our product, we started brainstorming
        key features that would be the most helpful to our users. We utilized
        our design requirements and user personas when ideating the app’s
        features and how users would go through a specific task. Overall, our
        information architecture showed the relationships and flows between each
        feature. This set us up for success as we started ideating and creating
        paper prototypes of our app screens.
      </p>
      <img src="assets/night-owl/ia.png" alt="information architecture" />
      <h2>PAPER PROTOTYPING USABILITY TESTING</h2>
      <p>
        The paper prototypes were a quick, easy way to test our designed
        features without distracting users with colors and photos. They helped
        us pinpoint confusing and unintuitive aspects of our initial features,
        which we incorporated into our redesign. First, we each individually
        sketched and described three interfaces. Then, we came back together and
        combined our rough draft sketches into consistent interface sketches for
        our usability tests. Based on our storyboards and information
        architecture diagram, we defined three key tasks that we asked users to
        complete in our tests.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Task 1:</em>User searches for a final destination, which will be
        home. Then they will select the path that they want to take and start
        their route.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Task 2:</em>User reports a burglary incident and inputs the correct
        information (date, time, description) and submits it. After submitting,
        check that it was successfully added to the map.
      </p>
      <p><em>Task 3:</em>User adds new safety contact and then calls them.</p>
      <h3>Participants:</h3>
      <p>
        We tested our prototype with four female University of Washington
        students who walk alone at night at least once a week.
      </p>
      <h3>Method:</h3>
      <p>
        For each evaluation, we followed three major phases of testing in order
        to cohesively gather quality information about our users and our app.
        The first phase started off with an interview with each participant in
        order to gather basic demographic information. The second phase
        consisted of the main usability testing by providing users with a task
        that they had to accomplish while observers recorded notes. During the
        test, we asked participants to think out loud so that we could better
        understand their thought process and pain points. To make it seem like a
        real application, we used a Marvel App to conduct our usability testing.
        Lastly, we performed a post test interview to get final details of what
        participants thought of their experience of our solution to night
        safety. After individually completing our usability tests, we came back
        together to synthesize and analyze our findings. We found commonalities
        in the features users struggled with, strengths and weaknesses of our
        design, and suggestions for redesign.
      </p>
      <h3>Key Findings</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Users wanted to be able to share their location even when they hadn’t
          started a path.
        </li>
        <li>
          Users did not expect the app to immediately call a contact after
          clicking on their contact tile.
        </li>
        <li>
          Users want to be able to quickly input information when reporting a
          hazard.
        </li>
        <li>
          Users stated that hazards have different urgency levels, which should
          be reflected in the app.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>REFINEMENTS</h2>
      <p>
        Based on our findings from our usability tests we made some changes to
        our designs. Below are the three main changes that we made based on user
        feedback.
      </p>
      <h3>Report a Hazard:</h3>
      <img src="/assets/night-owl/report.png" alt="report a hazard" />
      <p>
        Having different icon categories and hazard types was confusing, but
        users still wanted hazards to be differentiated in some way. We made a
        few changes based on this feedback:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Removed different icon types and only allowed users to report hazards
        </li>
        <li>Removed hazard types</li>
        <li>Allowed users to enter a title for the hazard</li>
        <li>Added hazard levels (low, medium, and high danger)</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Calling Safety Contact:</h3>
      <img src="assets/night-owl/call.png" alt="calling a safety contact" />
      <p>
        When users tapped on a contact, they expected to be taken to an editing
        page instead of it calling them, so we:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Added a “call” button so that users would know that tapping it would
          immediately call the contact
        </li>
        <li>
          Tapping on the contact’s picture would bring them to the editing page
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Select a Route:</h3>
      <img src="assets/night-owl/route.png" alt="selecting a route" />
      <p>We made a few minor changes to this screen to alleviate confusion:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Added “start route” button to collapsed menu</li>
        <li>Moved “start route” button to the side</li>
        <li>Added “From” text field at the top</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>ANNOTATED WIREFRAMES</h2>
      <p>
        Also based on our usability testing feedback, we redesigned and added
        aspects to our wireframes. Then, looking back at our information
        architecture, we created the app’s full functionality in Figma. These
        wireframes were supposed to be low fidelity without color and real text
        in order to strictly communicate the app’s features. We annotated each
        screen to highlight key components and describe functionality. This step
        helped us think about how our features worked together and was a useful
        way to get feedback before designing our high fidelity prototypes.
      </p>

      <h2>HIGH FIDELITY PROTOTYPE</h2>
      <p>
        Based on all our research and testing, we created an app called Night
        Owl, that students could use to feel safe when walking alone at night.
        The app has two main components: safety circle and map.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the safety circle, based on interviewees stating they feel
        comfortable when they’re walking and talking to their friend, users are
        able to quickly and easily call their friends. If their friends are
        busy, users can call the bot. The bot will record and talk to them,
        mimicking a ‘friend’ listening to you in case your are in a dangerous
        situation.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the map, users can select a destination and the safest path to get
        there. Once the user starts their route, their safety contacts will be
        alerted and the app will automatically send another notification when
        the user gets to their final destination; this happens automatically
        because it’s easy to forget to let your friends know you got home safe.
        To keep the incidents up to date on the map, we use crowdsourcing; users
        can report and confirm hazards.
      </p>
      <p>
        After user feedback, we made the SOS button be easily clickable, which
        brings up a popup that counts down from 5 seconds and then calls 911. If
        the user accidently pressed the SOS button, they can easily cancel it.
        But we learned that it’s important the SOS button be very quick to use
        in case of a dire situation.
      </p>
      <p>
        For our colors, we chose dark mode because users would be using this app
        at night, so we wanted the screen to be subdued. Our color scheme is
        dark blue, bright orange, and bright red. It is important to create high
        contrast to show key information. Orange represents important actionable
        items such as reporting a hazard and starting route. The bright red is
        used only for the SOS button to ensure it stands out in case of
        emergency.
      </p>

      <h2>REFLECTION</h2>
      <p>
        Overall, this project was challenging and definitely stretched our
        thinking in both design and teamwork. Working with a group to create a
        high-fidelity mockup for a product in just 11 weeks was difficult and
        required hard work from everyone. We learned that designing with a team
        requires clear and effective communication, compromise, and a lot of
        dedication. With that being said, we’re all proud of our final product
        and enjoyed every step of the design process.

        <li>More user research and usability testing</li>
        <li>
          Explore optimizing map path finding for users going between the same
          two places multiple times a week
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If we had more time, we definitely would have conducted more user
        research and usability testing. Specifically, it would have been useful
        to do competitive analysis on other technologies and services rather
        than just apps. Also, although a phone app fit our design requirements,
        we didn’t have much time to think about alternative forms of our final
        product. We definitely would’ve wanted to explore other options,
        especially since our user group of students walking at night should
        actually be discouraged from using their phones.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, there were parts of our app that we want to test more
        because we are unsure of their effectiveness or usefulness. One of these
        functions is the SOS button; we had gotten a lot of feedback about how
        to make it easily accessible while not making it easy to accidentally
        trigger. Based on user feedback, we were able to incorporate a solution
        into our final design, but we would want to test with more users.
        However, it was difficult to actually test the true functionality of the
        SOS button because it’s meant to be used in emergency situations.
        Another feature that we were unsure about was the ability to call a Bot.
        Some of our users said that they would feel weird talking to a Bot and
        wouldn’t use it, while some said they would. With more time, we would’ve
        wanted to figure out how to make this feature truly useful to our users.
      </p>
      <p>
        One really interesting question we received was about our research into
        how often our users were going between the same two points every week,
        and how we can optimize our map function to those users. This question
        was very thought-provoking; since one of our features was pathfinding on
        a map, we immediately turned to pre-existing solutions (e.g. Google
        Maps, Apple Maps) as a base. However, these solutions are made to deal
        with someone starting from anywhere and going to anywhere. Dealing with
        the situation of users going between the same two points multiple times
        a week might result in a completely different solution. If we had the
        time, we would want to explore optimization for this specific situation.

      <p>Finally, here are some key takeaways from each of us:</p>

      <p></p>
      <p>
        <em>Maya:</em> At the end of the project, I was surprised by how much a
        “final” design can still be improved. It was a little disheartening
        seeing how much critique our (almost) final design received, but when I
        thought about it, pretty much every design in the world can be improved
        in some way.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Valerie:</em> This has been one of the most incredible design
        experiences I have had. I love working in groups to design artifacts
        rather than trying to design something complex like Night Owl on your
        own. I loved watching our project grow as we shared ideas and made
        compromises about our designs. Each member of the team brought something
        very unique to the table, and although it was challenging to incorporate
        what worked best for all of us, it was in this diversity of the
        designers in our group that we were able to produce a product that we
        are all proud of.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Peter:</em> Overall, this experience from start to finish has been
        memorable. I enjoyed collaborating with my teammates as we each had
        important contributions to Night Owl. As for the project itself, we may
        have finished the first iteration of the high fidelity prototype, but
        there is still much improvements we can make, especially after our final
        critique.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Lia:</em>I learned how to optimize time and create quality work by
        understanding and using each team mate’s skills and passions. At
        different steps in our process, each one of us went above and beyond to
        help the project excel.
