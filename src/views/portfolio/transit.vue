        As a project, in an advanced design class offered through the HCDE
        Department at The University of Washington, I redesigned Seattle Public
        Transit. This redesign started with user research, to understand the
        audience of Seattle Public Transit in order to design for the actual
        audience. Next, came the creation of six tasks that a user on Seattle
        Public Transit would complete. Three of these tasks would be designed
        for a mobile platform, and three of these tasks would be made for a
        kiosk interaction which would be located at a transit stop. Next, there
        were diagrams of user flows, to understand how the user would interact
        with the system while completing their tasks. Then, we created low
        fidelity wireframes to understand and test the layout of these
        interactions. Then, we created mood boards and picked a typographic
        hierarchy and a color scheme. Finally, we created high fidelity
        wireframes which showcased the fully designed interactions.
      </p>
      <h2>USER RESEARCH</h2>
      <p>
        The Seattle public transit system is an integral part of the community
        and has a multitude of considerations to design for. This user research
        will describe Seattle public transit’s audience, purpose, platforms, the
        current strength and weakness of the Seattle public transit system, and
        an assessment of a public transit system with a better design framework.
      </p>
      <h3>Audience:</h3>
      <p>
        The audience of the Seattle public transit system includes many groups
        of people. First, we have two sets of primary users. The first primary
        user is regular people living in Seattle who use primarily public
        transportation and walking to get around during their daily lives. -The
        people using the service tend to be those with a lower income, because
        public transportation is more affordable than owning a car, especially
        in a city setting. On top of the primary users though, we see a large
        number of stakeholders who are also affected by public transportation.
        Because this transit system is funded by the government, that means that
        our taxes partially go towards paying for this system. So, anyone who
        pays taxes is going to be a stakeholder in the system. A few special
        considerations to account for when considering the audience of public
        transit is to remember the edge case users. There are a fair number of
        disabled people who are in chairs or who have walkers that take the bus.
        We also have homeless people riding the bus occasionally because it is
        the cheapest and warmest thing to do in the cold Seattle winters. The
        audience of public transit really does tend to be people who are
        disadvantaged.
      </p>
      <h3>Purpose:</h3>
      <p>
        The purpose of the Seattle public transit system is to help people get
        around the city/county. This is a service available to many people for a
        fairly low cost all things considered, especially when you consider how
        expensive it is to own a car in the city (spending 100+ dollars a month
        for parking alone is just not affordable!) . If I wanted this brief to
        be like 6 pages long, I would go on a rant about how public
        transportation should be free, but I will digress. Secondary purposes
        for this transit system include helping alleviate traffic congestion by
        putting more people in one vehicle and reducing the number of cars on
        the road. This is also a handy service for people who are not living in
        Seattle but are in fact visiting Seattle as they travel between all of
        the attractions in the area.

      <h3>Seattle Transit System Assessment:</h3>
      <p>
        The biggest issue there seems to be with the Seattle public transit
        system seems to be the distinct lack of cohesion between the multitude
        of systems in place for public transportation. The main two are Link
        Light Rail and King County Metro. But there are a number of other
        smaller transit authorities including but not limited to: community
        transit, the monorail, and water taxis. All of these systems seem to run
        on the Orca card, but they are managed by a large number of I have
        always been very confused as to why the Light Rail and the King County
        Metro Bus system have very different aesthetics. The color for king
        county metro is green yellow and red, which is an unappealing color
        combo. While link uses a white and blue color scheme. Community transit,
        another branch also follows the blue and white color scheme. The light
        rails main flaw is that the tap on tap off system is kind of a pain to
        use and the range of the light rail is very limited, but it is being
        expanded. The buses have a very difficult payment system where you only
        need to tap on. There are very few bus stops with kiosks to refill the
        clipper card or buy tickets.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don’t love Seattle public transportation. I used it freshman year and
        had some questionable experiences. But now I have a car in Seattle so I
        don’t really ever use transit unless I am going from the U district to
        downtown. I understand the system. I would change the system so that
        both king county metro and link light rail have a consistent theme, look
        and combined website. I would also make the west lake station more
        easily understood. When you take a bus out of Westlake it is from the
        same place you take the light rail. It is very confusing and should be
        reworked so that the markings are more clear and more easily understood
        and identified.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you search King County Metro in the App store, there is one app for
        purchasing tickets and it gets very poor reviews, and only has about 150
        reviews, so clearly it isn’t well integrated into the system.

        This brand book shows the steps of the entire design process, from
        creating a mood board and picking color schemes and typographic systems,
        to diagraming user flows and creating low and high fidelity wireframes
        for 3 interactions on a mobile device and 3 interactions on a kiosk
        system.
      </p>
      <h2>REFLECTION</h2>
      <p>
        The most substantial take away from I went through a few iterations of
        mood boards, as the foundation for the design process, before I settled
        on a theme that inspired me. To explore the development of the new brand
        aesthetic for Emerald City Transit’s, let’s take a look at the three
        iterations of mood boards for this redesign project.
      </p>
      <img src="assets/transit/mb1.jpeg" alt="neutral moodboard" />
      <p>
        The first theme that I came up with for the redesign of Seattle Public
        Transit, was “Calm for Commuters.” This idea stemmed from wanting to
        make people’s commute easier, but I was feeling uninspired by the
        concept of calm for commuter. I did however really enjoy the pink sunset
        vibes from this mood board.
      </p>
      <img src="assets/transit/mb2.jpeg" alt="green moodboard" />
      <p>
        The second iteration of the mood board is where we see the introduction
        of “Emerald City Transit.” I don’t even remember how it happen, but
        something got me thinking about Wicked, and I felt inspired. I wanted to
        add some fairytale whimsy to the users commute. But the monochromatic
        theme in green seemed a bit aggressive to me.
      </p>
      <img src="assets/transit/mb3.png" alt="green and pink moodboard" />
      <p>
        The final iteration of the mood board is a culmination of the first two
        mood boards. I took the pink accents from the calm for commuting mood
        board and combined it with monochromatic green scheme from my first
        iteration of the Emerald City Transit mood board. All things considered,
        the final product from this public transit redesign would probably not
        be incredible for a public transit system because it is so whimsical and
        cities prefer a more clean, clear cut design.
